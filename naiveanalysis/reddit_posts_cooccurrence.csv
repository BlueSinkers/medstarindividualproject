1074b0d,mentalhealth,"My therapist and my family say I'm making excuses not to fix my life, and I can't figure out if I am or if it's mental illness.","I've had a few different diagnoses and I shot myself in the head when I was young (in addition to other serious suicide attempts), so it's clear I have real mental health issues and am not just making stuff up. I also have IBD and had to have my colon removed and got addicted to pain killers after that (went to rehab and I'm clean now), and the IBD/short bowel syndrome slows me down a lot and can't work like a normal person can because of the fatigue and pain from it.  I also kind of lost my meagre life savings in the middle of last year (the Celsius crypto bankruptcy).

After that happened I kind of just gave up. I'm obviously quite depressed and I get that but they want me to just get over it and fix my life. I feel like I have failed so much in life that it's pointless, especially trying things again that I've already failed at. 

My therapists says stuff like ""Just go get a job"" and ''go join a gym so you'll feel better."" But with the way my life has gone I just don't feel like doing it. I'm stuck in this hopeless mode where that sounds impossible. But it also feels pointless because I just don't believe I can fix my life and whatever I've done in the past has ended in catastrophe. I also feel like such a loser I don't want to be around anyone, so I'm even less motivated to do these things. 

But everyone is just sick of me making excuses. I mean in theory I'd love to fix my life and be happy and normal, but anything people say about getting a job or whatever just seems like a fantasy to me. I know it won't work out. I can barely get myself to shower once a month. It's not that it's too hard, it all just seems so pointless. 

I can't even get disability because the rules are weird and I would have had to do it a few years ago, closer to when I was working full time.

I don't know what to do about this. I just don't want to try. Like no matter what I'm not going to have a good life anyway. The work I can do is limited, so I'll never make much money. I won't do anything meaningful or significant or fulfilling. I could go work part time for near minimum wage, but what is that supposed to do for me? I'll never get married or have a family. I won't be able to afford my own place to live again. What is the point of going out to try to do these things? It just seems like this life wasn't for me, I tried and failed. But that attitude seems to just annoy everyone who thinks I should just hop up and go be some kind of go-getter and let nothing phase me, and that if I just try then things will magically work out somehow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1074b0d/my_therapist_and_my_family_say_im_making_excuses/,1673237688.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

18yg4ry,mentalhealth,How am I supposed to find any direction away from this misery loop?,"I‚Äôm 30F and I feel so trapped in my life and stuck in a hole I can‚Äôt find a way out of.

I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to be happy and everything seems great when you list it out but I‚Äôm miserable every day. I have anxiety and depression so I understand I‚Äôm experiencing more depression. But nothing seems to give and get me to find a way out of it. I am on medication.

I had a decently paying job, own a house, married, have some wonderfully adorable pets and am trying to build up my own business doing something I actually enjoy that is more creative. I lift weights and exercise 4+ days a week. I‚Äôve eaten better but I balance my protein and nutrition. I limit alcohol and am not drinking at all for at least January. I am currently not having any weed either, but have been having really small bits of edibles from a local dispensary to help quiet my mind at night and help me sleep. I feel like everything in my ‚Äúformula‚Äù is right for a good life.

I hate the industry I work in. I hate my adult acne. I hate my hair. I hate the stress weight I‚Äôve put on and can‚Äôt lose. My spouse has his own business in fitness and because of this I am the only connection to insurance and benefits. I don‚Äôt even see how I can have MY own business because then we will be bleeding out for health insurance, and god forbid the cost of possibly having kids, which I can‚Äôt even address right now because I‚Äôm clearly too mentally unwell. Unless I work part time somewhere with benefits. And that really limits my abilities, because I can‚Äôt find anything remote and anything in person is likely retail and I‚Äôm not sure on the flexibility with my business since I‚Äôd need at a minimum most summer weekends to handle my work. And minimum wage part time plus a tiny business seems like it will crash our finances when we‚Äôre finally actually building a good nest egg for retirement and I‚Äôm finally making enough to build up my accounts.

And my spouse a few years ago was on his deathbed from IBD (we were just dating at the time) and had 5 surgeries, 3 considered emergencies, and I was basically his caretaker and it was devastating and traumatic. Then one of his parents passed from a devastating cancer. All it shows me is that anything can happen and I‚Äôm just rotting in a stupid meaningless job and wasting what little time I have.

Im exhausted all the time and feel like I‚Äôve never slept when I‚Äôm getting 8 hours. I have no energy to take care of much around the house. Im worried I resent my partner because he can have a happy career and I‚Äôm stuck and miserable so I can keep our insurance and yet he does almost everything around the house and barely if ever comments on it. 

I can‚Äôt find any way forward and I‚Äôm just trapped in a misery cycle. Every time I feel hope I think of the future and how it‚Äôs unrealistic and inaccessible. And we can‚Äôt move because then my spouse loses his entire client base.

Editing to add: I overanalyze and know a lot of my issues. Every time I talk to a therapist they act like I have everything together and just need a little ‚Äúpush‚Äù from some feedback and I‚Äôm on my merry way. So I haven‚Äôt found therapy helpful besides some EMDR for panic attacks.

She didnt care I was being bullied badly by this old woman I met a couple of hours after i broke my ankle who was so ignorant. I just wanted her to listen to me like everyone else who did. Also she didnt seem to understand I have hyperhidrosis which I have had since i was a young teen. She made some other stupid suggestions. 

She is one of the few people who doesnt enjoy my makeup and that is one of my main purposes in life as I never have had orthodox job at 30(i turned 30 today) and it is something that makes me really happy.

nu7vqi,mentalhealth,"I need advice on how to stop my nightmares, I can‚Äôt deal with this anymore","TW: sexual assault, death

Hey guys, I‚Äôm (22F) new to this sub but I hope someone can help.

Some background information:
I never experienced anything extremely terrifying like a near death or war, but there are certain things that might have caused trauma: 
- When I was 15 I was sexually abused. I said several times I don‚Äôt want to be more intimate, but he proceeded anyway and took my virginity. 
- In my teenage years I was with a narcissist that abused me emotionally.
- I developed an IBD.
- I witnessed an earthquake while at an airport. Because I didn‚Äôt feel the earthquake and people were screaming and running, I thought there was a mass shooting for a few minutes. 

I might have had a good amount of nightmares for a longer period of time, but as far as I can remember it started in 2018. 

There were times that I didn‚Äôt have nightmares or at least didn‚Äôt remember any of them. When I have them though, they feel like a lucid dream that I don‚Äôt have any control over. It feels so real, that there were times when I questioned if they had happened in real life. And I‚Äôm not talking about one nightmare a month, this happens like 5 out of 7 days a week.

I remember when this all started in 2018, I had dreams of my own death for several months. Those deaths ranged from being murdered by people I know to whole military invasions and executions. 
By then, the nightmares were already horrible, but I was killed pretty fast and woke up immediately so at least I didn‚Äôt have to feel all the horrible emotions for a long time.

The past year however this has changed. 
The dreams shifted from ending in my death to focussing on the things that lead to it or feelings of fear, helplessness, anxiety, neglect‚Ä¶
I wake up when the feelings are at their climax, often times I‚Äôm completely wet because I was sweating so much. 
The feelings stay for a while after I wake up and I‚Äôm tired throughout the day because I did hardly get any rest at night. My last dream was so bad, that I felt like I had no energy for 3 days. 

Examples:
1. I was held captive in a really small and empty room without windows. I tried to get out through a tunnel but got stuck and didn‚Äôt get out of this claustrophobic state for what felt like 30 minutes.
2. I ordered pizza, when I opened the door for the delivery man he stormed into my apartment and raped me.
3. I was held hostage with about 10 of my friends and all of them have been executed in front of my eyes.
4. I had to flee from a foreign military for several days in the forest. 
5. I went through shipwreck in the middle of the ocean on my own because of a storm. 

I tried to find a therapist but it‚Äôs completely impossible because of COVID right now. 
So please, if you have any idea how to stop these nightmares let me know! I want to rest at night again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nu7vqi/i_need_advice_on_how_to_stop_my_nightmares_i_cant/,1623056538.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
8d0px8,mentalhealth,I need help with my wife,"Things have gotten very out of hand with my wife and her anxiety. It stems from medical things. Her grandmother has diabetes, she panics that she does. Then a friend died young of cancer, she panics that she has cancer. Her father had a heart attack (survived and doing well), she panics that she's going to have a heart attack. It's hard to tell whether there is something medically wrong with her or if it's a panic attack and anxiety.

She's had diarrhea for about a month now and is convinced it's cancer or an IBD even though in the 4 trips to the ER have shown she's only been a little dehydrated. All within this time, she has seen her primary and a GI, who wanted to do both endoscopy and colonoscopy. She only did the endoscopy so far and bailed on the colonoscopy because she feels that making someone do the prep is abusive (her words). I've tried to get her to eat small, soft foods. Done everything I could find  and what the doctors and nurses suggest but she won't keep up with it after a few hours. Even medicine is like, take one dose>I don't like it>never takes again. I've been tough with her, her mother has been tough with her, even the doctors and nurses have beeb tough with her. One nurse even told her to stop b/c nobody wants to be around the crazy stomach lady (not in meanness but in honest trying to help my wife b/c nurse deals with the same stuff). But my wife just can't...I don't know, get a grip on her nerves and mind? She's been out of work for the month now and I've been working from home trying to help her, being her caregiver 24/7 but it's hard. She's always pushing against anything we try to help her with. She just secured a spot for a colonoscopy this Friday so you can imagine the panic right now. She had a psychiatrist appt scheduled that day and she cancelled it for the colonoscopy. We're in a tough position. 
She truly wants the prep to happen in the hospital under supervision. She's talked to 2 GI's about this who both said they don't do that unless emergency admits them into the hospital. I feel like she's looking for every little thing (on top of every feeling she's overthinking about already) to go to the hospital just so she can be admitted. I've been trying to get her to eat but she says everything hurts. She was last at the ER on Sunday where everything was fine. She eats and has diarrhea, but I mean, she hasn't eaten in days anything but water and pedialyte with some clear Ensure. I need to keep her together until her colonoscopy (during her endoscopy she insisted on not having meds and nearly ripped the camera out, the nurses had to hold her hands down)........any advice to get me through til Friday would be appreciated and how to handle her anxiety after, like is a psychiatrist the best? Why are they so damn busy, seriously next booking in 6 weeks.

Looking for Participants for a Study on Mindfulness Meditation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"My name is Gillian Potter and I'm a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. I'm conducting research with adults who live with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis and have experience with Mindfulness Meditation (at least a weekly practice). Mindfulness meditation is described as a practice of using an intentional, nonjudgmental, and accepting quality of attention towards present-moment experiences of the body and/or mind.

In this study, you will be asked to take part in an individual interview about how mindfulness impacts different aspects of your life. Some of the questions will include, ‚ÄúWhat role does mindfulness play in your life?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow has mindfulness impacted your experiences with your illness?‚Äù This information will be used to better understand the processes of mindful living in the context of IBD. Participant names will not be used in this research, and any personally identifying information will be changed. 

All that would be involved is a telephone or Skype interview. If you fit this profile and are interested in participating, please send me an email (gillian.potter@usask.ca). Your help would be greatly appreciated, and would work to inform medical and psychological interventions in chronic illness! 

This study has been approved by, and received approval through, the Research Ethics Office, University of Saskatchewan. There are no conflicts of interest in this research to be declared in this research. I would be pleased to provide any additional information you may need!

But this also means I barely go out except to see my mum. I have to look after our baby 24/7 with little help.

When he wakes up he's instantly in pain, which is so awful for him, and we'll have the same conversation every morning about how he doesn't want to face the day. I get anxious when I hear the bedroom door open because I know what's coming.


I just want us to be a normal couple, go out for a meal, even a walk. Have help with the baby and the house. Live our lives in enjoyment instead of every single day being depressing. Have different conversations that aren't about how much he hates Crohns.

MIKE had struggled with depression his whole life, but one day in 1995 it all got too much. ‚ÄúI completely fell apart,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI backed out of life.‚Äù

Mike tried to kill himself with an overdose of prescription painkillers. Medics saved him, but the next 15 years of treatment brought little respite. He cycled through dozens of types of antidepressants, with side effects including sickness, insomnia and anxiety. Nothing worked.

Then, in 2010, Mike received a call from his doctor, offering him the chance to take part in a clinical trial. Rather than targeting brain chemistry, as most standard antidepressants do, this was a trial of a drug normally reserved for Crohn‚Äôs disease, an inflammatory bowel condition where the body‚Äôs immune system attacks the gut. Desperate for a break, he signed up. And it worked. About a week after the first treatment, the fog of depression cleared. ‚ÄúI just sort of woke up,‚Äù Mike says.

My body feels fraught with battles fought silently for years‚Äîa constant, gnawing reminder of a war waged within. Today, that relentless pain is unyielding, and I am overcome with a deep grief, a mixture of physical torment and an aching sense of loss for the dreams of daytime ease.

Across the room, my daughter beams at me with pure, unadulterated joy. In her bright eyes is the reflection of a world untouched by my struggles‚Äîa world I long to keep safe for her. She is a picture of innocence, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing inside me. I yearn every day for her to see me as the fun, engaging, ever-present dad. I want to be the source of adventure and happiness in her life‚Äîa souce of positivity, filled with energy and love.

And yet, here I am, a man burdened by layers of pain and moments of self-pity. The internal conflict is fierce: each day is a battle to hide the throbbing ache, to stave off the despair that creeps in with every flare-up. Today, as I sit here, I feel stranded between the desire to be her rock and the crushing weight of my own exhaustion. The invisible scars and relentless pain have me at a moment where self-doubt and sorrow eclipse the hope I want to pass on.

In fleeting seconds, I catch myself glancing at her‚Äîa fleeting spark reminds me of the strength I still carry. Even though today is marked by despair, it is also a reminder of the love that fuels my journey. It is the fierce hope that despite these dark, tiring days, there is a better tomorrow waiting to be embraced. I clench my hands, trying to hold onto that belief as tightly as I hold onto the memory of brighter days when my laughter was the loudest sound in our home.

In this raw moment of vulnerability, I understand that being a dad is not about projecting endless happiness. It‚Äôs about the courage to stand by her, even on days when the pain is overwhelming, and to show her that it‚Äôs okay to feel every emotion deeply‚Äîeven the sorrow. I wish for her to learn that life is woven with both light and dark, and that sometimes, our strength lies in our willingness to acknowledge the struggle and still move forward.

Even as exhaustion tests my resolve and the pain resurfaces like an unwelcome guest, I remind myself that hope and love, though sometimes hidden, are never truly lost.

1lhxl6v,mentalhealth,The Cost of Showing Up,"
A short story about the struggles of living with crohn's disease.

I sit at the table, watching the wedding unfold around me‚Äîone of my partner‚Äôs friends. Laughter ripples through the space, glasses clink in celebration, and plates are piled high with food. Everyone seems to be basking in the moment. I know they each carry something heavy‚Äîeveryone does‚Äîbut not all of them suffer like I do.

I sit there in quiet agony. My body feels like it‚Äôs betraying me: the bloating, the aching joints, the ever-angry fistula. Every breath is calculated. Every smile, a performance. I crack jokes, not just to keep the mood light, but to remind myself that I still can.

The drinks come around like clockwork‚Äîglasses raised, champagne bottles popping, trays of shots gliding past my line of sight. Every polite ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù I give is a fresh reminder. Not just of what I can‚Äôt have, but of what separates me from the ease everyone else seems to live in. I smile, make some self-deprecating joke about staying sharp, but underneath it all, it stings.

It‚Äôs not really about the drink.

It‚Äôs about being reminded‚Äîagain and again‚Äîthat I can‚Äôt partake the way others can. That my body has its own set of rules, and tonight, I‚Äôm just trying to obey without letting it show.

I catch myself wishing‚Äîwishing I could trade places with anyone else in that room. I don‚Äôt care who. I don‚Äôt need to know their story. I just want out of mine for a while.

But I stay.

I laugh. I toast. I blend.

Because that‚Äôs what surviving looks like tonight.

Later that night, I collapse into bed, utterly drained. My head is heavy, my limbs buzz with fatigue, and my stomach churns like I‚Äôve been drinking all night. But I didn‚Äôt have a single sip.

This is the hangover I know: not from alcohol, but from effort. From performing normalcy. From smiling through the pain, from keeping my mask in place for hours while the rest of me screamed for rest.

1kzyl06,mentalhealth,My employer is trying to make it impossible for me to work,"Apologies if this is posted in the wrong place I just need advice. 

Over the past 12-18 months I have been suffering with my mental health. I was in an abusive relationship which I had to flee, I lost a friend and then lost my grandad which was very traumatic as I had to sit by watching him gasp for breath. 

I used to live in a different city with my ex and his family, it wasn‚Äôt a great relationship but the last 2 years of it were bad. In the last year of that relationship I got a job but during my probation I almost ended up in a women‚Äôs refuge it got that bad but I stuck out till I passed my probation then with the help of family I left my abusive partner. 

My workplace are trying to get me to go back in full time which is a 200 mile round trip as I now live at home with my parents as I had no where else to go. My employer expects me to move back to my area of trauma for a minimum wage job and is choosing to blame my circumstances on me. 

At the beginning of this year I had a huge mental breakdown, vivid flashbacks and I was signed off work for just over 2 months, when I came back my gp recommended a fit note for me to work from home. That fit note runs out in 2 weeks time. 

I‚Äôve been having one to ones with my manager (not as frequent as they should be) and I‚Äôve always asked if there‚Äôs any concerns on his part and he‚Äôs said no. But yesterday he booked in a one to one with no prior warning and my director was also present, they said I‚Äôve been underperforming and when my fit note runs out I have to be in office full time no ifs no butts. 

I had a flexible working arrangement before my sick leave to be in office once every two weeks as I have Crohn‚Äôs disease, a brain tumour and mental health issues which makes a 200 mile round trip difficult enough. 
And with my mental health I‚Äôve been prescribed mirtazapene as I wasn‚Äôt sleeping. When I take my tablet I‚Äôm still woozy/ sleepy for around an hour after I wake up, and I‚Äôve figured out that I‚Äôm still sleepy for around 12-13 hours after I take it. My manager doesn‚Äôt seem to care about this and wants me to drive in. Which would mean me setting off at 5:30-6am every day and not getting home till 8-8:30pm. 

Even prior to me being put on mirtazapene I got tired behind the wheel to and from work. 

Can they sack me if I get another fit note to work from home? I‚Äôm worrying like mad i haven‚Äôt slept much since or ate I‚Äôm literally so scared of losing my job as I need the money ",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kzyl06/my_employer_is_trying_to_make_it_impossible_for/,1748702212.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1idtkec,mentalhealth,Help me! :( I don¬¥t know what to do with my life as a medical resident?,"I¬¥m a 27 yo male medical resident (internal medicine) in Germany and I absolutely hate my job. It¬¥s way too stressful and the responsibility is overwhelming. I want to quit. But I have invested so much in this career path already. I am passionate about philosophy, biology, astronomy but instead of studying philosophy, I chose medicine because it seemed like a safe option and I wanted to be financially secure. I also suck at maths lol

So I called in sick for 2 weeks and I¬¥m probably about to be fired next monday. I don¬¥t know where to go and what to do.

I also have Crohn¬¥s and am fatigued a lot of times and I also struggle with anxiety and depression. I have been in therapy for the last 2 years but I only have 5 more sessions left...

I live with my parents and have no debt.

I¬¥m not really interested in medicine at all. I thought I could become a family medicine doctor because I like the idea of being self employed but I would have to go through over 2 more years of training in a hospital. I have only worked for 9 months but I¬¥m completely burned out already. I have to work for 24 hour shifts with very little rest twice a month. I am so scared of making a crucial mistake due to exhaustion that I can¬¥t do another 24 hours shift.

1jd8dnq,mentalhealth,When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,"Lately I‚Äôve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being ‚Äúweak‚Äù and affected . I know it‚Äôs not true but I also wonder if it‚Äôs true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you‚Äôre a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it ‚Ä¶. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I‚Äôve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I‚Äôm  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I‚Äôve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I‚Äôm terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn‚Äôs , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I‚Äôve been trying to manage everything in my head and it‚Äôs not executing properly . I can‚Äôt even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I‚Äôm supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it‚Äôs an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I‚Äôm also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I‚Äôm so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it‚Äôs an excuse and I‚Äôm not allowed because I didn‚Äôt do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It‚Äôs driving me crazy . I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and it‚Äôs making me freeze and depressed and I just don‚Äôt want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest. I want to but the fear of messing up and overwhelm and no energy is stopping me.

1httlbd,mentalhealth,HELP! My girlfriend has gone compleatly blank. Just stares into space at all hours.,It started arround Christmas time. She recently has been trying to improve herself because she sometimes can have explosive anger. While doing this she fell into her own rabbit hole of guilt during self evaluation of her whole life. She is known to ignore and distract her self from her problems rather than sorting them out. Every single tramitic event surfaced at once and she is blank....emotionless just gazing into nothing. She is very difficult to communicate with. When she does respond on whats bothering her she will talk about a different traumatic event or guilt in her past. Its a compleatly different answer each time and takes hours to get out of her.. I'm terrified she will hurt herself or she will be like this forever. We took her to the hospital and they were little help. They did identify something was wrong but she might get over it? Sure okay....  I'm giving her her space now but I do keep reminding her how much she is loved and telling her our love stories to remind her life is worth living. I dont expect any solution but I am hoping someone may recognize thease symptoms or have similar stories to help us get through this. She absolutely does have a traumatic past. Multiple traumatic painful Surgeries installing an ostomy bag and a reversal due to unattended crohns disease and a reversal. A very abusive relationship with some not so consensual sex.

1l1oz56,mentalhealth,chronic physical illness leading to mental health deterioration of my brother.. what do i do?,"my brother (27 yo) has been struggling with chronic illness (gut issues ‚Äî ulcerative colitis and stomach problems too) for about ten years. it has dramatically affected him and his lifestyle. he‚Äôs self isolating from every one, he has cut ties with all his friends who kept pursuing him for the longest time but he just kept blocking them, he left his full-time
job to start a freelance career (which he never started because he‚Äôs waiting to get better and healthy first). his physical health is not at a life threatening level, but it is very inconvenient: everything irritates his guts in a way, whatever soothes his stomach flares the colon and vice versa. this leads to sleepless nights, a lot of pain, weight loss, bleeding, being anemic and generally weak, body image issues (even tho he looks okay not that skinny), and ofc more and more isolation. he only ever talks with my mom or me who live with him, and all he talks about is trying to figure out what to eat every single meal. 
he refuses to see new doctors (physical or mental) because he believes they are the ones who led his condition to worsen (partly true, but we haven‚Äôt consulted 10 doctors in 10 years, and we‚Äôve been regulars with only one of them) who isn‚Äôt able to help. dietary control is impossible because there is zero stability on what hurts and what doesn‚Äôt. he‚Äôs been following a trial and error approach and it is almost always failing and ending up with much more pain. sometimes a meal wouldn‚Äôt mess him up a day or two, but then it would. 
at this point, you can imagine his mental health: closed up in his room all day and night for years, refusing to even get out, to see new doctors because they‚Äôre not going to help him, and all therapy is rubbish ‚Äî what do therapists even understand about what he‚Äôs going through? and he can‚Äôt take medication because of his gut issues. even a simple cold lasts forever with him due to this problem. he‚Äôs also quite obsessive and i would say from my pov is showing a lot of narcissistic traits that only hurt him.
my mom and i are feeling helpless. he‚Äôs only fighting and yelling and shouting and getting nervous breakdowns lately. there is no way we are going to get him outside his room without his consent. we think he has completely lost his mind and that he would just die of grief or kill himself, not in the very far future.
i am not sure if there is anything to do at all. we can‚Äôt find solace or provide him with any effective support. any recommendations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l1oz56/chronic_physical_illness_leading_to_mental_health/,1748887385.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Other people can help and try to understand but we as people have a big problem with accepting, attempting comprehending and knowing their worth and issues and discussions.

So my words aren't going to everyone feel something but if at least one person reads this its a chance it could help or understand. So here goes.

There was a night growing up that would seem to be the first of many catalysmic events that would change many peoples lives but mostly and massively me, my sisters, mom, dad and grandparents lives. Short version-mom was cheating around behind my dad and he found out for sure. That night something in his brain snapped and he lost it. All forms mental, emotional and physical .l.e. reasonability, realism, logic and ethics, and sensibility were damaged deeper and massively than a regular cheating scenario. He went through years of downfall. he lived in a hell his mind made up and tortured him and kept pulling him down until February 17, 2017 he couldn't take it anymore. The one thing I'm certain he knew is he was Pushing his family away and his incredibly dark and horrifyingly intrusive thoughts and beliefs took over and destroyed him. That was the the most important and severe event to have ever or will occur. I never learned to cope in a good way and never wanted to face reality. My family has at least one major mental disorder or flaw and most of us if not all are stubborn and ignorant. We've all made very bad choices that have caused large consequences. For the time of 2017 to 202l2  I was a mental and emotional wreck. I was in and out of hospitals and eventually diagnosed with crohns, Ibs, ulcerative colitis, Gad, depression, adhd, bipolar, ocd, and finally diabetes type 1. I couldn't keep a job let alone wanted to work. I didn't know responsibility or anything healthy. I was persistently and constantly letting my thoughts and anxieties put me in horrible moods and have horrible outlooks. Basically I was in a very very bad place slowly but steadily killing myself and burning bridges. But out of all thative had great experiences, coincidences and phenomena happen and help me learn grow and change all aspects of myself. And mostly the horrible events were the ones to teach me the most. And with all the bridges I've burned. Being jobs friends family or girlfriends every single person had a part in me learning and growing. And I couldn't be luckier and more fortunate. The things that has mainly been my biggest epiphany is my lovely girlfriend who I couldn't want anything else. But before we got together and during I was drinking very heavily and irresponsiblly. I was an alcoholic. Been to rehab, had seizures. Last straw u wrecked. Got a dui and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without that blast and the help of my girlfriend I would've been drowning further and eventually doing something absolutely deadly or irreversible. Medicine has been a huge factor also in assisting or taking my disorders and issues. I don't think people should take meds and expect for the meds to change your life. It's still you. But last thing I'll write here is this. And I really mean and believe this and hope you catch a glimpse of belief but no matter what you're going through. The Good bad ugly is up to you to make an effort and try. If you never try you never will have a chance of it even happening. And no matter how depressed or low you are or in your head. I promise promise promise you can overcome it even instantly. I know some things are chemical but anyone can overcome depression they just have to want to and mean it and they have to put in effort and find any way they can. Anything is possible if you believe and try. 

There's a saying for overthinking that hit me hard too. It's by Allan watts and its also a good song

A person who thinks all the time
Has nothing to think about except thoughts
So, he loses touch with reality
And lives in a world of illusions
By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull
Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words
Of reckoning and calculating
I'm not saying that thinking is bad
Like everything else, it's useful in moderation
A good servant, but a bad master
And all so-called civilized peoples
Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive
Because, through excessive thinking
They have lost touch with reality
That's to say
We confuse signs
With the real world
This is the beginning of meditation
Most of us would have
Rather money than tangible wealth
And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed
And to read about it the next day in the newspaper
Is oddly more fun for us than the original event
This is a disaster
For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs
We are destroying nature
We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses
Time to wake up
What is reality?
Obviously no one can say
Because it isn't words
It isn't material, that's just an idea
Reality is
The point cannot be explained in words
I'm not trying to put you down
It's an expression of you as you are
One must live
We need to survive, to go on
We must go on",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17x9870/a_little_of_my_story/,1700203936.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

urjim0,mentalhealth,Will I ever feel normal,"Hi, was hoping to get some perspective and personal experiences living with a mental illness. Specifically, I am struggling to understand how to come to terms with having a mental illness and how to ever decide if my thought process is sane. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis at the age of 16, and am currently 24 years old. When I was initially diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, I was in a physically dangerous state; I have always been a thin male but during my first flare I had to try different medicines to get my colon under control when I was bordering on needing hospitalization because of aggressive weight loss. I am 5'7"" and the heaviest I have ever been is \~135lb (I was only ever able to achieve this weight by forceful eating; e.g. 4 raw eggs immediately waking up to try and get free calories, 1500 calorie weight gain protein shakes, gulping down shot glasses of olive oil, 5 minute ice cream binge sessions housing a third of a cartoon if I ever got a burst of hunger). My natural maintenance weight is between 120-125lbs with my colitis in remission state when I am not consciously forcing myself to over eat. During my initial flare I was flying close to 100lbs, partially because I was a belligerent teenager and just said had a fuck it mentality and elected to starve myself so I could actually make it through a day of school, attend parties, or socialize. I strictly didn't eat during school hours because I'd be liable to need my mom to take me home within the hour and wouldn't be able to endure the rest of the day of school with my stomach in so much pain and the diminished ability to control my bathroom needs. So long story short, was prescribed an aggressive schedule of steroids (prednisone) if memory serves me correctly it was a good 3 months I was taking 60mg a day because it was pretty much stop the colitis flair or try other medicines like biologic where a lot had studies showing an increased, but infrequent risk of cancer in young males. Don't blame my parents at all for adamantly not wanting me to touch those. I unfortunately, was in the group where prednisone caused psychological effects. Best way I can explain is it, I got all the symptoms associated with roid rage in addition to insomnia. I genuinely slept 2-3 hours a night, and while I've never taken coke or meth the side effects would be what I imagine a person using meth experiences; paranoia, grandiose ideas, god complex, explosive mood swings, and full blown suicidal ideation. I DO NOT have suicidal thoughts any longer, and got help at an in-patient facility which i stayed at for 2-3weeks on three different occasions. Fast forward and was able to get my colitis under control and after about a year finally felt like the steroid related side effects subsided but was diagnosed with bipolarity which conveniently aligned with the steroid therapy catalyzing. No one ever explicitly said the steroids caused my mental illness but most medical professionals agreed it was very possible the steroids triggered the mental illness's appearance. Okay now that back story is explained. My main question and appeal for advice is how does one ever trust their conscience and thought process anymore. I feel like I spend 20-30% of my brain power a day, having to manually vet every thought I have to try and prove it is a logical, sane thought. I take Lamotrigine 200mg, which I do like and have no side effects from aside from the benefit of it helping me to bounce between a -50 to 50 sanity scale versus -100 to 100 without it. For some odd reason, I am terrified to try any other psych medicines aside from benzos. I ran through all the top medicines prior to Lamotrigine and had varying side effects so I'm petrified to ever take a pill that alter my brain chemistry. I lost like a month of memory on seroquel, don't even remember who I was on cymbalta, clomipramine worked mildly but at the max doses it didn't help much. I am against a wall and a hard place, because I am so stressed over being insane and questioning every internal thought I have. I wake up limping because stress dreams are causing me to curl my toes so hard I'm ripping my calves muscles. I want to try and get Valium to just calm down my head and relax my muscles, but I imagine no one is ever going to prescribe it. I currently have a psychiatrist who I check in with to get my Lamotrigine refills, but will be trying to do some televisits with some new ones to get their vibes and see what they think and what could help, but I just can't do this bullshit with exercise to release stress yada yada. I work out multiple times a week, go for runs, drink a gallon+ of water a day but all those activities still afford me too much time between push up or running stride to think. Sorry if im all over the place, just really fucking discouraged that after 6 years of having shit under control it feels like my psychological health is digressing again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/urjim0/will_i_ever_feel_normal/,1652783800.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
tt3g9o,mentalhealth,Are these common symptoms of panic attacks?,"28 yr old male.

Yesterday I took a nap after work. I woke up and called my wife, who was elsewhere in the house, to see if she could grab my cane (I have a torn hip labrum and ruptured disk that was hurting especially bad). I was having a rough week, as my hip was hurting, I had an Ulcerative Colitis flare up (blood in stool) and I caught my sons cold. 

I stood up off the couch and waiting for my cane. After a minute or so I started to feel like I was going to vomit. Then came a sense of lightheadedness and dizziness. A feeling of dread came upon me and then all of a sudden I felt really really cold. I started to panick and walked up the stairs. My body was like lead and it was like I was there, but not there at the same time. Dream like. I couldn‚Äôt get my words out and my body felt totally cold and unmovable. I thought I was going to lose consciousness for sure. 

I sat on the stairs and my vision seemed weird and my ears started to ring. I couldn‚Äôt hear very well, I could hear my muffled voice talk and that was it. After sitting down, my face and my hands started to have a vibration sensation. It was especially strong in my hands. After calming down, we noticed I was drenched in sweat. 

I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to say I had my family call 911. But I swore it was the end for me. By the time the first responders got to my house, I was coming to. My blood pressure was low, but it didn‚Äôt concern them. All other vitals checked outZ  

I‚Äôve had panic attacks in the past, but this concerned me as I‚Äôve never had it to this exact degree and with new symptoms : ears ringing, out of body, heaviness about my body, vision, vibrations, etc.

My brother was neuro-divergent. He turned to a different type of pharmaceutical to manage his mind‚Ä¶.opioids.

1h9q92z,mentalhealth,Has anyone else called 911 because of panic attack (anxiety attack),"I (21F) have been having anxiety attacks that sometimes escalate into panic attacks for a while now (like 6months ish). Last friday i had a panic attack again and it got REALLY bad i thought i was going to die so i called 911.

I was sure something was wrong with me and that i was going to die. My heart was going so fast, i had a horrible headache, my whole body was shaking, i had extreme dizziness and i couldnt see straight (everything was blurry/blacked out). It took me about 15 minutes to actually call 911 i kept thinking i was having a stroke or something. My thoughts about dying wouldn‚Äôt stop and i kept repeating ‚Äúi dont wanna die‚Äù over and over. Calling 911 was scary on its own, cause it was the first time i was calling. I told them what was happening and while crying and barely controlling my words.

The first responders came and took my pulse and walked me through my breathing, i was shaking so bad. And then the paramedics came and took my vitals and they told me i was fine, they reassured me that it was probably a panic attack and i wasnt about to die and they told me my uncontrollable shaking was probably due to adrenaline... It‚Äôs my finals and im stressing so much about my exams and i spent the whole day at the library and barely ate, so looking back this was definitely because of anxiety.

Now i feel stupid because i called 911 only because i was having a panic attack. Has this happened to anyone?? I feel like i overreacted and now i just have more anxiety over it.

1m67ptx,mentalhealth,A New Way to Understand Depression ‚Äì The ‚ÄúStress Triangle‚Äù (Not Medical Advice),"I‚Äôve been exploring a model I call the **Stress Triangle** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a simple way to visualize how depression can feed on itself. Think of it like the **fire triangle** (fuel, heat, oxygen), but for stress.

The three parts are:

* **Cortisol (üî•)** ‚Äì the stress hormone that affects mood, sleep, and memory.
* **Stressful Thoughts (üå¨Ô∏è)** ‚Äì negative loops like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get better.‚Äù
* **Painful Memories (ü™µ)** ‚Äì unresolved experiences that fuel the system.

Each one amplifies the others. A bad memory triggers thoughts, which raise cortisol, which then strengthens the memory loop. Break one corner, and the triangle weakens.

This isn‚Äôt a replacement for therapy or meds, but it might help explain **why it‚Äôs so hard to ‚Äúthink‚Äù your way out of depression**‚Äîbecause the stress response is doing more than just affecting your mood.

Would love to hear your take on this model.

  
Edit: the Stress Triangle model is a simplification of depression and is used to represent stress and how that can become a system with interactions which amplify each other. To model depression with the Stress Triangle, further mechanics and models are required, including (but not limited to) the Polyvagal Theory and HPA axis dysfunction.

My partner (26) is going through a difficult time with little support besides me and has nights where she seems confused, disoriented, paranoid.  
  
Longer version: My long-distance partner has had nighttime episodes of what seems like psychosis. Saying things that aren't grounded in reality, accusing me of things I've never done/are impossible, believing that pets sending messages to her mind, etc. They are very intense and emotional nights.

In the 10+ years I've known her and the time we've been dating, I haven't seen her like this. She's been through a lot her whole life but she's going through an especially difficult time right now. The sibling she lives with says she isn't acting out of the ordinary and that I must be an outlet for the emotions she suppresses during the day. But that explanation doesn't make sense to me. She doesn't remember these nights and is very worried and apologetic about them. She doesn't know what's going on.

1m7kyrg,mentalhealth,Do you have a stress disorder?,"I recently decided that my depression like symptoms from the last two years were not caused by grief, low self-esteem, or other common mental health stressors. I went on to a search and figured out that the root cause can come from disorders in the body. This is what I found:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excess cortisol, known as hypercortisolism, can result from several different conditions and mechanisms. Here's an overview of the main causes:

**Cushing's Syndrome** This is the umbrella term for any condition causing prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels. It can be caused by:

* **Pituitary adenomas** (Cushing's disease): Benign tumors in the pituitary gland that secrete excess ACTH, which then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. This accounts for about 80% of Cushing's syndrome cases.
* **Adrenal tumors**: Both benign (adenomas) and malignant (carcinomas) tumors of the adrenal glands can directly produce excess cortisol, independent of pituitary control.
* **Ectopic ACTH syndrome**: Non-pituitary tumors elsewhere in the body (commonly lung, pancreatic, or thyroid cancers) secrete ACTH, leading to excessive cortisol production.

**Medication-Related Causes** Long-term use of corticosteroid medications (like prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone) for conditions such as asthma, arthritis, or inflammatory disorders can suppress the body's natural cortisol regulation and create a state similar to Cushing's syndrome.

**Stress and Lifestyle Factors** Chronic psychological stress, severe depression, alcoholism, and intense physical stress can lead to persistently elevated cortisol levels, though typically not as extreme as in Cushing's syndrome.

**Pseudo-Cushing's States** Certain conditions like severe depression, chronic alcoholism, or poorly controlled diabetes can mimic Cushing's syndrome by causing elevated cortisol levels without an underlying tumor or glandular problem.

The symptoms of excess cortisol typically include weight gain (especially around the midsection and upper back), purple stretch marks, easy bruising, muscle weakness, high blood pressure, diabetes, mood changes, and characteristic facial changes. Proper diagnosis usually requires specialized hormone testing and often imaging studies to identify the underlying cause.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my case it turns out that my body generates lots of stress and that it depletes my Vitamin C and likely my magnesium which are both needed to manage stress and cortisol production. I have since been taking lots of Vitamin C each day and it has really helped me recover my old energy. I'm not quite back 100% but it has made a huge difference and I wanted to share because I am sure there are others out there that can relate.

1iqn6ph,mentalhealth,"New Analysis: 95% Correlation Between Seed Oils & Alzheimer‚Äôs Mortality (r = 0.95, p < 0.0001)","Alzheimer‚Äôs cases have skyrocketed over the last 70+ years. A new analysis finds a 95% correlation between rising seed oil consumption (soybean, canola, corn, sunflower oil) and increasing Alzheimer‚Äôs deaths.

Key findings:
‚úî Pearson correlation: r = 0.95, p < 0.0001 (extremely strong)
‚úî Regression analysis: 90% of Alzheimer‚Äôs mortality rise aligns with seed oil intake
‚úî Non-linear trend: Alzheimer‚Äôs deaths accelerate as seed oil use nears 100%

How do seed oils contribute to Alzheimer‚Äôs?
‚Ä¢	PUFAs oxidize, creating neurotoxic aldehydes that damage brain cells
	‚Ä¢	Chronic inflammation from Omega-6 excess worsens neurodegeneration
	‚Ä¢	Mitochondrial dysfunction weakens neuronal energy supply
	‚Ä¢	Insulin resistance (‚ÄúType 3 Diabetes‚Äù) is increasingly linked to dementia

Given the data, should we be re-evaluating dietary guidelines and eliminating seed oils?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1iqn6ph/new_analysis_95_correlation_between_seed_oils/,1739691696.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1hhpfgu,mentalhealth,"My grandma has Alzheimer‚Äôs (maybe depression too), it‚Äôs getting worse. How can I help?"," 	My grandma is about 70 years old, she suffered from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. I have to start back before she was diagnosed. For a while, my family believed that she is depressed. Before COVID, there was a period of time where she‚Äôd act different and sit in a dark area of the house, alone doing nothing. But when my little cousin was born, she seems to recover and went back to her normal life where she would cook and do various activities throughout the day, such as picking up my little cousin from school. During COVID, she fell back into the same behavior. She doesn‚Äôt cook, doesn‚Äôt eat much, doesn‚Äôt put much care on hygiene, doesn‚Äôt do anything other than sitting in the same place and play sudoku. It was odd. I kept wondering how could a person sit there and play sudoku everyday, no breaks? 
Then, she had an accident where she fell and broke her hip. Was hospitalized for around a week. Initially, when she came home, she didn‚Äôt play sudoku at all. She said she forgot how to play them. After a couple weeks, she got back at the Sudoku again but she doesn‚Äôt sit in the same place anymore. She sits in the living room. She has a routine: simple exercising with my mother, playing sudoku most of the time, read books for my mom (to let her talk more), and sleep. 
	She likes to say that she doesn‚Äôt sleep at night at all, complaining that she has insomnia. She also worry about her digestion, saying she‚Äôs constipated even though she‚Äôs not. Even when we told her she was snoring, she still said she didn‚Äôt sleep at all. 
	Lately, it‚Äôs been getting worse. Now, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs winter or not but she seems to lose track of time. She‚Äôd say I‚Äôm going to sleep now when it‚Äôs noon, asking my grandpa to give her the sleep medicine (she takes 2 every night). She repeat the same thing again and again, sometimes 3-4 seconds apart. If I were to count, she probably repeat some of these phrases 20-30 times a day. For example, she kept telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget to charge my iPad‚Äù. Or, she kept telling my grandpa what she wants for breakfast again and again. We tried to tell her that it‚Äôs not time yet but she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. Explaining to her that it‚Äôs not time yet doesn‚Äôt do anything at all. 
With that being said, she still has a pretty good memory of the past. She remember all the trips we went back then and remember certain events pretty well, so it‚Äôs confusing what‚Äôs really going on in her mind. Also, for the Alzheimer‚Äôs, the doctor said she still in the stages that is not too bad I think. 

I feel so bad for my grandpa since he has to take care of her most of the time. It must be so frustrating for him to listen to the same thing again and again. And the fact that my grandmother doesn‚Äôt understand what she‚Äôve been told made it even more tough. If someone experience similar scenario with someone they know, i would really appreciate if you can share it or give me some advice on how me and my family can deal with this. Thank you so much for reading this.

191wgiq,mentalhealth,What can you do about someone with Alzheimer's?,"My niece drives for Uber/Lyft sometimes to make some extra money and she just called me with an interesting story and asking for advice.

She went to pick someone up at Wal-Mart, but they weren't standing there waiting for her when she got there. She waited a minute, then tried to call the person, but got no reply. She waited a couple more minutes and the person called her. She sounded panicked, afraid, and crying and just kept saying she wanted to go home and no one would help her. My niece was finally able to ask her some questions and apparently this lady was inside wal-mart and refused to go out of the store, she wanted someone to go in and get her and bring her to the car and all the other uber drivers just canceled the ride and left her there.

She was very panicked initially and my niece felt bad for her, so she went in, got her and she seemed really jumpy and nervous, but finally went to the car with her and she started to take her home. She began calming down on the ride and talking to my niece, and my niece could tell something was not right upstairs with this lady. She would ramble at times, she seemed to forget basic information and repeat herself a lot. She finally recognized she was almost home and said ""I live just up here on...."" and couldn't remember the street name.

My niece asked her if she lived alone and she said yes.

&#x200B;

To both of us, we feel like this is a very dangerous situation for this lady that seems to struggle to do simple things like buying groceries. I told my niece i'd think about the situation and see if I could come up with something, but i'm kind of at a loss. I am really tempted to get my niece to take me to this woman's house and check up on her and just try to have a chat with her about her situation. On the one hand, I don't want to be intrusive in her life and cause her any grief or trouble, but on the other hand I don't want something bad to happen to this old lady because no one is looking out for her and she very obviously seems to struggle to take care of herself.

I rarely go anywhere or do anything.,"So this weekend hubby, 22year old son and GF all went out. My son has always said if I invite one of you that means both of you. I get home from picking up Groceries and they‚Äôre leaving. I asked if they could give me a second to wet my hair down and freshen up. They said no we are already to go. So I said I can put groceries away make sure Nana is settled and meat up with you guys. I did exactly that. I was kind of hurt because the place they went after Dinner was an Alice and Wonderland Themed bar. Anyone who knows me knows I love AIW. I have a book club called The Mad Hatters reading group. I‚Äôve loved these stories since childhood. So son and GF basically just brushed me off. That was hurtful because she stays at my home a lot. She gave me an eat shit and die looks. I don‚Äôt even think she said hello. Now I‚Äôm uncomfortable in my own home and on top of it all I‚Äôm caring for my mom who doesn‚Äôt even know how to dress herself. I am super uncomfortable around my sons GF now and I feel very isolated. To think they‚Äôd go somewhere that‚Äôs more my thing than hubbys hurt me. I have said I was sorry that I showed up for an hour but it was fun seeing all the AIW stuff they had. I‚Äôve been in tears on and off since Saturday. My son said I‚Äôm glad you guys had fun because we didn‚Äôt. Meaning hubby and I had fun. I feel like a girl staying at my house shouldn‚Äôt be so rude and not even acknowledge im an actual person and her BF is my son.  I know I‚Äôm all over the place with this. I just feel so dead and alone. It‚Äôs like my soul is hurting and to express that would make light of my son not having fun because I was there for one hour. I have said I‚Äôm sorry. I explained to him what he told me that if I invite one of you meaning his dad or me I am inviting you both. I don‚Äôt know what to do and feel like maybe my hubby has said something to make him not want to be around me. Yes I made one remark that I shouldn‚Äôt have to hubby but I said I was sorry that it really hurt that they chose a place that was more of something I would like than they would. I also said I was sorry for ruining the evening. And said it was my fault and I hope he can forgive me. He is barely talking to me and I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Im so uncomfortable with him and his GF ignoring me.  It hurts and I have so much more than just those 2 to deal with. My mom pooped in her diaper last night so I had to clean her up and put her in the shower. I was crying because I felt overwhelmed. My son said you brought this on yourself. How did I ? I took her to the bathroom like I‚Äôm supposed to evey 4 hours.  Am I crazy? Well I am ADHD and bi polar so kind of. Was it wrong for me to want to have a drink with hubby, sonand GF.   Im just wondering how I can feel comfortable here. With them ignoring me and acting like I have the plague. My heart is so broken and I am having suicidal thoughts which I can‚Äôt share not just because of them but it‚Äôs hard taking care of someone with Alzheimer‚Äôs.  Please someone tell me how I can go about letting this woman whose sleeping in my home make me feel less than and worthless. Maybe I am.  Just don‚Äôt know how one hour of them being out for hours ruined their entire night. I can‚Äôt stop crying and I‚Äôm getting really ticked at times being treated poorly and ignored.

I'm sitting at my desk freaking out cause I picked up the habit of repeating words in my head again and this time the two chosen words were of course ""Dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's"". However, every like 5 minutes I'll completely forget the word ""Alzheimer's"" and have to google something else to find the actual word and it's really freaking me out  
I have a page open right now which I searched with ""dementia causes"" and it has the world Alzheimer's in it, when I see the world I instantly go ""Ah yes, that is exactly the word I forgot"". But I've had to do it now like 20 times and I'm starting to get really worried  


For the past nearly 5 months I've suspected I have some form of Memory Issue but with no actual signs of any memory issues at all, I went to a GP (Live in the UK) and they said at my age any form of Dementia or Alzheimer's was basically impossible, but the entire interaction felt rather dismissive.  


I've also been repeating common words in my head to keep them fresh on my memory but it's slowly driving me through the wall, stated earlier my two recent words have been ""Dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's"", I repeat those two words in quick succession and I might be good for the next few seconds to a few minutes, I have done the same thing with different words for the past 5 months and I don't know how to stop. IIRC I've done, My name, my birthday, where I was born, I list every family member I can think of on the spot, I've added friends into the mix a few times and currently whenever I do ""Family"" I choose my two closest friends.

1legzbb,mentalhealth,Could my sister have young onset dementia or something similar??,"Hey all. As the title suggests, I have a younger sister who's facing some difficulties. In uni right now, in our microbiology unit, we're studying Alzheimer's and dementia and how Amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain contribute to deterioration of neurons, and therefore, Alzheimer's. It's freakishly similar stuff to what my little sister has been facing since I believe late juniour high to the beginning of high school. 

In essence, she gets these episodes (she used to call them ""forgetty moments"") where she'll behave similarly to a senile elderly person- asking where the bathroom is in her own home, then instead wandering out onto the enclosed porch; forgetting how to use a fork properly; saying things that don't at all make sense; motor skills temporarily becoming infantile/primitive; stuff like that. I worry about her!

My parents took her to a specialist with a really long and hard-to-pronounce name who diagnosed her with some form of epilepsy and prescribed her a medicine. Last I heard she still gets the episodes, just not as frequently, and had one on the job (for the first time) here recently. 

I've never heard of any epilepsy or seizures causing this kind of behaviour, but I suppose it's possible. If anyone here knows more about this subject, please, enlighten me! And of course it's of great concern whether she'll get Alzheimer's or dementia later on; my great grandmother had it, but in the short time I knew her before she died I never really got to see it because she lived in a nursing home. So far as I've studied in uni it's not *exactly* hereditary in terms of Mendelian inheritance/genetics, but I've read that having a family history of it can contribute to the disease being more common.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1legzbb/could_my_sister_have_young_onset_dementia_or/,1750252934.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

1j5kzpl,mentalhealth,What's wrong with my partner? Early dementia?,"My partner (55M) seems to have really gone downhill in his day to day functioning in the last few years, and it's gotten to a point where I am concerned for his (and my) physical safety. 

Examples; 

\-he opens a cupboard to find a bottle, says its not there, I open the cupboard, its literally right in the front at eye level.

\-Crossing the street without looking (distracted by phone) almost getting hit by a car. Raging at the driver who slammed on the brakes and honked.

\-Extreme inattention when driving, almost rear ending a car even though he was looking straight ahead.

\-Shutting a door on me because he forgot I was behind him after walking together for almost 10 minutes

\-Leaving the shower on and flooding the bedroom.

These kinds of things are constant, I feel I am looking after a toddler. Worryingly, he has a job where safety is of the utmost importance, and I am starting to fear he might hurt someone/himself. 

His eyesight/hearing is fine. But he is unwilling to admit there is a problem (says I am nagging/condescending/judgmental). The more I bring it up the more irate and defensive he gets. 

He is a heavy drinker and keeps irregular hours (due to his job) and has become overweight. He possibly has some form of ADHD (I am speculating) but the last year has gotten noticeably worse. 

He is increasingly cold and distant physically/sexually. 

I'm not sure what to do; is it depression, mental illness, alcoholism, trauma? All of the above?

1f5prm6,mentalhealth,Worried About a Friend's Possible Dementia,"Someone I care about deeply is acting in a disturbing way. 

She doesn't remember things, she refuses to look at facts to verify she's wrong, she's belligerent, yells and screams, wants things only her way with no compromise even when it doesn't make sense or is impossible, etc.  

But it is only sometimes and mostly at home. Her mother had Alzheimer's and it is a worry. With her mom it came in fast and destroyed her in a heartbreaking way.

She is under a lot of stress at her job as an executive assistant to a CEO and also taking care of elderly father and a number of siblings with mental illness challenges.It could be that she is under too much stress and is taking it out on family and friends at home.

However her behavior is starting to become a problem. She is making threats, being physically and verbally abusive, damaging property, and fabricating stories that make no sense. She seems to be loosing touch with reality. 

I don't want to have her taken to the hospital if it can be avoided. The hospital can be very traumatic and adds a terrible stigma to your life.

At the same time people's lives are being affected.

 She is costing people and their companies money, she is inflicting trauma on a disabled household member by demanding they do things they are not capable of due to the disability, she only communicated when she wants leaving people to guess on what she wants but screams if it's not delivered, she prevents others in the house from accessing the kitchen to eat. It is a nightmare.

We love her. It will be awful for her reputation and her own self-image if she has to be taken to the hospital or if the police have to get involved. 

I have personally been subjected to a number of abuses by her. I cry at night because I don't know how to help her and she is destroying my spirit with her hostility and attacks.

Any advice for solutions would be appreciated. 

We've heard the ""change the locks"", ""call the cops"", ""have her committed"" ideas. We're hoping for something more positive focused if possible.

We want everyone to be safe and happy. Sending her to a hospital will remove her from the home but it won't make anyone happy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1f5prm6/worried_about_a_friends_possible_dementia/,1725117741.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1etezgt,mentalhealth,"What duty do I have to my elderly, narcissistic mother with dementia?","I‚Äôm 58. My father sexually abused me when I was 12. My mother did not divorce him until I was 16. She is suffering from dementia now, largely due to her being an alcoholic for most of her life. She‚Äôs also a raging narcissist so nothing is ever her fault and she is a gaping hole of need. 

I do not love or even like my mother. She has rewritten the narrative of her life to suit what she wishes it had been, such as talking about how she‚Äôs so glad she left my father immediately after he abused me, which is totally not true. 

My whole life she has been mean & self-centered. When she found out my first child was going to be a boy, the first words out of her mouth were ‚Äúson of a bitch!‚Äù She wanted a girl. Hard to say why since she expressed NO interest in her grandchildren at all. Even after I had the girl she wanted me to have. She never once took them to a movie, had them sleep over, did any type of activity with them. When the kids were in school, she would come see me occasionally during the day so I could take her thrift shopping. She would stay long enough for the kids to get off the bus, get a picture with them that she could put on FB, and then leave. 

She has lived with her partner for 30 years now and they are both elderly, live 1.5 hours away. FWIW, the partner shot my mother in the stomach in 1994 because my mother attacked her in an alcoholic rage. I handled all of mom‚Äôs care - getting her COBRA, changing the dressings on her wounds - everything. All while caring for my newborn son. After she recovered, she went back to the partner. While she is no longer drinking, she‚Äôs still a piece of work - alienating pretty much everyone in her life.

I have a sister who did not really help much in years past. For one thing, she‚Äôs much younger than I am. She‚Äôs now started to step up - she has POA and goes to see our mom on Fridays. I have gone a few times with her and I HATE every second of it. She hates it too. With all my heart, I would love to walk away. Say I am done. My therapist says I can and probably should.

I was prescribed sertraline and propanalol to help me after I experienced 2 extreme dissociation panic attacks in a row where I felt like nothing was real, I wasn't real, couldn't recognize anyone etc.

I have had mild periodic depression/anxiety my whole life but never experienced anything this serious it just came out of nowhere.

It feels like my brain got a factory restart. Every day i get slightly better, but im still struggling. I feel like a baby learning how to live again because I became scared of everything.
every time i go outside i dissociate so badly i feel half blacked out. switched off. I've been going on walks every day to try and get used to it. im slowly getting better, but very slow and its been a month. my doctor wrote me off work until the 30th, but I don't know if I'll be ready to go back by then.

I just want my old life back and i have no idea what's going on
I have this sense of doom constantly in the back of my head. I don't have desire to do anything because every time i leave my house i just black out. my vision even starts to cloud up like a migraine. the longer i spend outside my house the stronger the dissociation becomes. 

I am scared that I'll become so dissociated that im completely not conscious. it feels like losing consciousness when it happens. it feels like absolutely nothing is real like I've just discovered im in the matrix. like im in a computer game. that's why I thought i had dementia at the start because I couldn't feel anything about myself. I didn't have my personality. i was just a body. I didn't feel connected to my memories.

does anyone know what's going on? or how i can fix this because this is no way to live. i feel like I'm taking a back seat to my life and I'm not actually living it. just existing as my body moves around and tries to sustain itself.

wtwl2c,mentalhealth,I'm in my 20s and have memory loss problems.,"I have serious memory issues. For example, I keep forgetting my phone and even forget what someone had just said to me the other day. I have lost so many items due to my poor memory. Surprisingly, I've had this problem since I was a kid. My friends will reference major events from our school days, and I look at them blankly. It's agonizing because I'm constantly trying to hold onto snippets of memories and important key moments from my childhood. 

For some reason, I can still recall some of the painful moments from my past. They're scattered like bits of paper in a well, but I can piece them together as a string of single instances ‚Äî disconnected from one another and in no particular order. It's messy and somewhat meaningless, but it's what has stuck with me as I've grown up. Thoughts enter my brain and swim away faster than I can catch them. I forget what people tell me. I have to take meticulous lecture notes or I‚Äôll forget what‚Äôs been covered. I forget what I've read, what I've seen, and what I've done. It's awful. It's like my brain is constantly out of focus. It picks up some details, but everything else is blurry, disorderly, and confusing. Honestly, my memory loss is one of the most complex parts of my life, and it‚Äôs started to make me feel helpless.

1lhrgvi,mentalhealth,Memory loss and suppressing emotions?,"Hi all, it has come to my attention in the recent year that I genuinely seem to have a problem with recalling things but more specifically things I've said. This isn't the nicest thing because in the past I spoke without thinking and said a lot of rude and uncalled for things, but the problem is it makes taking accountability a little difficult because I truly, truly cannot remember most of the time if I had done something. This caused me a lot of issues before so it's made me just resort to thinking a lot before speaking and I assumed I've only been forgetting because of how much I used to suppress at the time, not assuming it was my ADHD because it seemed a lot more specific than just the overall being forgetful.

My friend had brought up something I had only said a month ago about an exam, saying I was claiming something specific about one of the questions and I can't recall any bit of it for the life of me. It's obviously not important because it doesn't affect anything, but it makes me worry that my tendency to forget things I've said never went away, it just isn't causing an issue in my relationships anymore. I genuinely cannot recall things I've answered in exams, things I've said, compliments I've given, exchanges I've had - it's so difficult for me to remember most things I've said.

Now I'm even more worried because as I'm dealing with moving on from the past, I try to combat the unproductive overthinking and dwelling by completely shutting it out or silencing the thought to avoid negative thinking. Is this a form of suppressing emotions?? Is this aiding me in becoming forgetful again??

1lmry8f,mentalhealth,"I'm struggling to cope, between material losses and memories of school bullying","Hello everyone,

I feel the need to talk about this somewhere. These last few months have been very difficult for me. I experienced an accidental fire at home two months ago. I managed to avoid the worst, but I lost a large part of my belongings, including my laptop, my camera, and some puppets I had created for my art studies.

These objects weren't just material; they were linked to my recovery. Since elementary and middle school, I've suffered constant harassment: insults, physical violence, isolation... and this has left me with chronic anxiety. I recently developed chronic gastritis, so I rarely go out, and my social anxiety is severe. I had found some solace in photography and artistic creation, and their loss has been very hard to take.

I'm not trying to get out of any trouble or use this as a defense.  It was a petty crime for a $6 dollar item but I have no memory of it and apparently I've done it once last week and again yesterday?  Anyway, it's a class 2 misdemeanor and I have no prior record and I know that most likely the outcome will be minimal.

My concern is that I am doing this and possible other things and not remembering it.  I was also told that I fell yesterday.  I don't remember that.  I called my mechanic to schedule a car repair and he asked me to bring it in yesterday morning in which I agreed.  I remember nothing after that until I woke up 4 hours later.  I went out and got into my care and my seat was moved all the way back as if someone taller were driving it.  No one drives it but me.  I am single with no other drivers in my home.  So now I'm wondering if I did go to the mechanic yesterday morning and don't remember that.  Later that evening I brought my dog with to go for a ride in my car.  I ran my errand, came home and found my dog in my driveway freaking out.  I never leave my dog he's always with me., he's an esp.  I am also having issues with falling asleep on occasion as if I have narcolepsy but I don't at least to my knowledge.  I just face plant and I'm out in what ever position I fall in.

I am also experiencing a huge increase in my anxiety tics today not due to the theft circumstance but other determining factors that I'm anxious about.  They are much worse than usual.  Another determining factor could be my inability to sleep.  I only slept a few hours in 2 or 3 days but that's normal for me as I have bad insomnia at times.  I am completely confused, people are calling me freaking out because they posted my picture on the store fb page and I don't know what the heck I did!  I feel like I'm losing my mind!  I've spent the entire day into this morning just trying to figure out what would cause me to do that?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.  I highly doubt I'm going to sleep at this point.  I'm worried about leaving and going anywhere now because I'm afraid of this happening again.  Thanks all.

After a few hours he himself would wake up and start asking us who we are,  he loses his memory that time .

One thing which made me question about his memory loss is that he always remembered his office laptops password even after losing his memory one more thing is that he also remembers a specific thing and that was to not play minecraft because it was addictive as he said before losing memory. After losing his memory yet he remembers that minecraft is addictive.

I am really tired of feeling this way. 

End of May 2025, I started to experience right upper back pain for about two weeks and then sharp pains in abdomen started alongside GERD symptoms. I naturally went on google/reddit to see information on pancreas which alarmed me. 

I went to A&E who told me it was gastritis and prescribed me PPIs/omeprazole. They didn‚Äôt do a scan. My GP referred me for an urgent ultrasound. 

My scan shows everything okay apart from fat infiltration on my pancreas which is inconsistent with my age. I am 31F. 
As you can imagine, with previous fears around the pancreas this alarmed me. 

My symptoms have since intensified, with more frequent sharp pains in abdominal both sides & the back pain now moving over primarily to my left side?! 

I have since seen my gastrointrologist who took an account of all my symptoms including my ultrasound results. With that in mind, I told him my fears of pancreas (C word). He told me he cannot say that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not that although is unlikely. He is also looking for IBD since my cal protection was 105. 

He has since requested:
Fecal elastate test
MRI of pancreas and bowels 
Endoscopy 
Gastroscopy

abtwrp,Anxiety,"Anxious parent of little kids, Crohn's, and the non-existent appetite","So, here's my dilemma.  I'm a dad of two beautiful little girls, ages 5 and 3.  Everything is great and I love being a parent.  For some reason though, ANYTIME the girls get sick or appear to be coming down with anything (cold, flu, stomach bug, whatever), it triggers my intense anxiety.  I get super anxious, in part, because I don't know how to help them when they're sick, however, I don't really panic in the moment, nor do I try and run away... I more just suffer in silence and handle whatever needs to be handled.

The internal side effects of my anxiety is that my body basically stops functioning properly.  I 100% lose any appetite that I had, I tend to not eat for a week or more at a time.  And I ultimately lose a lot of weight.  I fluctuate anywhere from 160lbs to 185lbs in a given cycle.  When things are anxiety free, my eating habits are totally normal as soon as anxiety is triggered, it's a 100% boycott on food...  Like,  I couldn't even force myself to eat if I wanted to...

It's also worth mentioning that I have crohn's disease too.  I feel like the crohn's flares up when my anxiety does and vice versa (anxiety when crohn's issues begin).   I mostly manage my crohn's symptoms with diet versus medication.  I take an anxiety med (buspar), that sometimes seems to help but most often doesn't seem to help at all for controlling my anxiety.

I feel like I've scoured the subreddits for someone with similar struggles but I haven't really seen much.  Does anyone else experience something like this?  Or just intense anxiety with child illnesses?  How do you cope?

I've been trying to cope lately by telling myself that ""Everything is going to be just fine, kids get sick and that's just the way it is.""  and ""We'll get through this, because we always get through this"" and ""One sick day out of 365 days a year, isn't the end of the world"".  Sometimes it seems to help, sometimes it doesn't.  Fortunately, I have a very supportive wife who is always willing to step in and do extra when I can't handle things sometimes.  I'm very grateful for that, but my inability to be myself in certain situations just adds to the anxiety.

Appreciate any thoughts or feedback on this.

3f9kz2,Anxiety,"You don't have food poisoning. It's not the flu. You don't have an infection. If you're nauseous right now, it's just a panic attack.","I've been submitting and contributing to this subreddit for a few weeks now, and I've come across a good handful of people who experience panic attacks like mine: with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and even a low-grade fever. Let's get through this together, guys and gals:

It isn't food poisoning. Food poisoning sets in within the first 30 minutes of eating contaminated food. You aren't sick. It's not e.coli. It's not salmonella. Your brain just wants to pretend it is.

Fever below 101F? Nauseous? Feeling some tummy trouble? Vomiting resulting from an infection isn't something you can hold back. There isn't a slow buildup of nausea until you start retching. If you have the flu, it's gonna come out fast. Unless you taste sulfur (like rotten eggs) when you burp a little, you aren't going to throw up. If you DO throw up anyway, it's your brain deceiving you into exhibiting the symptoms of the thing you're afraid of. You're okay. Even if you're still being sick, you WILL be okay. It WILL go away. It's okay if you can't help it. You aren't weak for succumbing. You haven't failed. It's just bad, rampant hormones. It will go away.

Baby yourself through this. Treat yourself well. Listen to your instincts about what you need to get through this. Want to camp out in your bathtub so the toilet is right nearby? Grab yourself some pillows, blankets, water, saltines, and your phone or computer. Camp out. Even if it's in a funny place like your bathtub or your hall closet - if you feel safe there, go there. It WILL help.

Breathing exercises work for some, but not for everyone. ""Happy thoughts"" work for some, but not for everyone. If you find that deep, cleansing breaths and picturing daisies swaying in the springtime breeze doesn't do a damned thing for you, that doesn't mean it's not a panic attack. It just mean your disorder has an extra-tough candy coating of ""fuck you"". There are other ways to get through it. You'll figure them out in time. Until that time comes, focus on positioning yourself so you at least feel in control of your environment. Nest. Stay hydrated. Take an antacid - it will help with the reflux. If you've got diarrhea, take an imodium (half a pill to start with - follow the directions on the bottle) or some pepto bismol (pink bismuth)(Do NOT take a separate antacid and imodium alongside pepto. It's one or the others). The chemistry and pH in your digestive system is thrown off by your panic. That's why you feel sick.

Now, let's get some white noise going. Some people find comfort in music. Some don't. I, personally, find a lot of comfort in writing to you guys and watching comforting tv shows. Here are some links, all of which are free and available for streaming (make sure your adblock is on. These sources have been very good about limiting any phishy stuff, but better safe than sorry):

[Mythbusters](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/mythbusters)

[Good Eats](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/good_eats)

[Bill Nye, the Science Guy](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/bill_nye%3A_the_science_guy)

[Holmes on Homes](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/holmes_on_homes)

[The Magic School Bus](http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/the_magic_school_bus)

I find the above shows really comforting because, not only are they light in plot content, but they're educational and engaging. When you're engaging the learning center of your brain, it can help distract you from feeling sick and panicky. That same website has a ton of available shows to watch - take a look around and look for whatever you like :) 

Another, more obscure, site that I sometimes use [plays the Animal Crossing hourly music in real-time according to your timezone](http://tane.us/ac/)

You're gonna get through this. It's nothing more than misfires in your brain causing a big, fat release of stress hormones. Those stress hormones can not only cause hyperventilation and feelings of impending doom, but it can also pretend to be the flu or food poisoning. It's neither of those things.

Treat yourself like your ideal, doting momma would. Picture the ultimate comforting figure. What would they do for you if you were this sick? Would they build you a pillow fort? Bring you water and your favorite stuffed animal? Your baby blanket? If you cowered in the bathtub for 4 hours straight, would they give you blankets, pillows, and put on The Magic Schoolbus? Do it. I don't care if it's emasculating. I don't care if it seems childish. In times like these, babying ourselves can be the best medicine.

Finally, and most importantly, it's absolutely, 100% okay to feel this sick. This panic disorder is just that: A disorder. When epileptics have seizures, we don't shame them for it. When a person with Crohn's Disease has a flare-up, we don't shame them for it. Just like with autoimmune diseases, just like with epilepsy, just like with any other chronic disorder, we can't control our symptoms. We can't control when they're going to hit us. Medication and therapy can help, yes, but FORGIVING ourselves can also help. Letting ourselves just be sick, just be anxious, and just be panicky without trying to power through it is okay. You're not weak for needing to do that. You're just letting this ugly little bout take its course. Sometimes, leaning back, hunkering down, and waiting for the storm to pass is the kindest thing you can do for yourself, and can be the fastest way out of it. You're gonna get through this.

**tl;dr:** Treat yo self. You'll be alright. You're awesome, guys; no matter how crappy (sometimes literally) you may feel right now. It'll go away, and this subreddit is gonna be here whenever you need it.

1m30jc7,Anxiety,Could this still be anxiety? Functional vs Inflammatory dilemma ‚Äì looking for insight,"
Hi everyone,

I'm a 34-year-old male from Hungary, and I‚Äôve been dealing with uncertain digestive issues for a while now. I‚Äôve had periods of real fear and anxiety about whether this might be Crohn‚Äôs, and I wanted to share my story to get honest input from those actually living with it.

Symptoms:

All started with classic gerd symptoms 3 years ago what have subsided by using of PPI medication

Then symptoms have changed to eatly satiety and nausea after eating(zero pain) 1,5 years ago. I have vomitted twice, 1,5 years ago

Post-meal bloating and gassiness (especially lunch)

In the last two months the nausea is lessened

But I am experiencing sudden, strong urge to defecate shortly after meals(lunch mostly), sometimes with mild abdominal cramping (lower left / around belly button), in the area of sigmoid colon. Usually this is happening 1 hour admfter lunch but It's not unusual to experience this even 1-2 minutes after meal.

Usually I have only one bowel movement per day(normal Bristol4), but in the last 1-2 momths its Bristol 6(loose) sometimes mixed with type 4 in the same bowel movement. So all in all 1 have diarrhea one day a week, one-two occasion through that day. Then back to normal stool in the other days.

No visible blood or mucus, never had fever or night sweats

Reflux, nausea, bile in the stomach (diagnosed on endoscopy) my official diagnosis is duodendogastric bile reflux

Colonoscopy 2 years ago was completely clear,

Blood tests: no inflammation markers, no anemia, B12 is normal(closer to the lower limit)

Iron & transferrin saturation were elevated, but genetic test excluded hemochromatosis

Other factors: I do have enomous health anxiety, and I‚Äôve noticed my symptoms get worse when I‚Äôm more stressed. Tbh I am living under chronic stress since years

Gastric emptying seems delayed based on symptoms (early satiety, occasional nausea but no vomitting since 1,5 years)

I try to keep a detailed symptom and stool log. For example, this week I had 2 healthy Bowel movement on Tuesday, no BM on Wednesday and today (Thursday) I had a loose BM (Bristol 6) but with some formed parts too. This pattern has been happening for several weeks ‚Äî mostly normal BMs, but about once a week I get this post-meal urgency and a loose stool, sometimes with cramping that passes away after I go and finish the BM. Also passing large amount of gas, what helps the cramping.

What worries me: Could this still be early/mild Crohn's, even with a clean colonoscopy 2 years ago?

Does anyone else with Crohn‚Äôs have episodes that mimic IBS ‚Äî urgent diarrhea that then settles, with long periods of normal stools?

Is it possible that a small bowel lesion or stricture was missed? As I have health anxiety I have checked most of the posts in this sub, and the wast majority of people claiming pain with strictures. I have no pain.

I‚Äôm not asking for diagnosis, of course, but I would really appreciate hearing if this sounds familiar to anyone here ‚Äî either from early Crohn‚Äôs days or from a misdiagnosis journey. I‚Äôm especially interested in the functional vs organic inflammation experiences others have had.

Thanks in advance to anyone who reads or replies üôè",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m30jc7/could_this_still_be_anxiety_functional_vs/,1752840348.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1jfsk1z,Anxiety,Is there any way to reduce the nausea/vomiting induced by anxiety?,"Recently, I have quit marijuana and nicotine after extreme heavy use for 4 years. What I have noticed, is that, my anxiety is extremely bad. ESPECIALLY in the morning. It's like my body is producing a supernatural amount of cortisol every morning. This leads to me feeling nauseous and vomiting. That's not all though, as I have trouble eating basically throughout the entire day.

  
Now, this is very detrimental to me specifically. I am a bodybuilding path, and I am already way too lean. Losing more weight will just lead to muscle atrophy. I am in college, and this is all just stressing me out so much. 

  
I've had this problem for a while now, ever since I was 16-17. I thought it could have been CHS, the doctors thought I might have had Crohn's, and I really don't know at this point. The only thing that helps is marijuana, but at this point I can't keep using that as a crutch. Besides, it's not even a guaranteed fix.

1l32wl0,Anxiety,"I‚Äôm trying to figure out if my high heart rate is similar to others who have anxiety, or more specifically, GAD along with Panic Disorder like I have.","Before you say anything, I know this has probably been asked before. My question though is more specific for people that have either GAD and/or Panic Disorder which I‚Äôve been diagnosed with both. The second reason I‚Äôm asking this question is because I‚Äôve had numerous doctors throughout the years dismiss my issue with my high heart rate as just being anxiety. 

That brings me to today, so I‚Äôm looking to figure out if my pulse is similar to others that have an anxiety disorder. I‚Äôm just trying to determine if other people are similar to me so I can reassure myself that my heart is fine it is just anxiety causing it instead of something scarier having to do with my heart.

My resting heart rate always hovers between 95-105 and then whenever I stand up to do literally anything it shoots up to between 150-170. I‚Äôm currently an adult male that‚Äôs 5‚Äô10 and 152 pounds. I‚Äôm currently healthy but I do suffer from ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis but they‚Äôre in remission now. The only issue I have now besides my anxiety disorders is that im really anemic and basically no iron in my body. I didn‚Äôt know if that would be relevant but I thought I should add it just in case. 

I also need to be open about medications I take because typically the meds I am on would decrease my pulse‚Ä¶ by a lot since most of them are CNS depressants‚Ä¶ but they do NOT actually decrease it or maybe it does but possibly not enough.. yet doctors still think it‚Äôs just my anxiety, which it might be but I still want to see other people‚Äôs answers. I‚Äôm currently take Metoprolol Succ 50mg/once a day, Clonidine .1/twice a day, Alprazolam 1mg/3 times a day, Baclofen 10mg/3 times a day, Cyclobenzaprine 10mg/3 times day, Buprenorphine/Naloxone 8mg/2mg twice a day, and Adderall 10mg/twice a day (it isn‚Äôt the Adderall either, my doctors and I already tested it by monitoring my heart rate on days I took it and days I didnt. We only found that my Adderall increases my heart rate on average by 3-5 bpm so not enough to cause my issues).

1hvxl8s,Anxiety,Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I‚Äôve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!

I have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!

**Body Oriented:**

* **Turn Your Room Cold** \- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.
* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \- It‚Äôs refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels.
* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \- If you‚Äôre lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.
* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your ""dive reflex,"" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.
* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.
* **Sit on the Floor** \- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.

**Mind Tricking:**

* **Spell Words Backward** \- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.
* **Count Things Around You** \- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.
* **Force Yourself to Smile** \- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you‚Äôre okay.
* **Do Some Math** \- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.

**Behavorial:**

* **Flip Your Environment Around** \- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.
* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.
* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.
* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work.
* **Gratitude** \- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.

**Environmental:**

* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution.
* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).
* **Smell Something Really Strong** \- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can ""shock"" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.

**Interactive:**

* **Carry Something Heavy** \- Holding something with weight can help ground you.
* **Balance on One Leg** \- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you.
* **Scribble** \- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you
* **Stare at Something Moving** \- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.

I've had anxiety for a while, but it was typically just generalized and hardly ever resulted in full blown panic attacks so I'm somewhat new to this.

It's been getting progressively worse over the last year especially as life got.. progressively worse.

Anyways, I've got a lot on my plate, and I made a really bad mistake recently that i'm trying to rectify, but that on top of everything else that's been going on my anxiety has been through the roof.

How do i stop an oncoming panic attack or stop one that's happening? My hands are freezing and tingly, my legs are shaking, my breathing is increasing etc. like I feel it getting worse, and I don't know what to do.

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

n0y195,Anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways.

1h0v600,Anxiety,Fear of brain cancer/dementia/previously unknown stroke/TBI/Alzheimer's/neurodegenerative disease. Suggestions?,"Throwaway, obviously. 

Guys, I have been going *through it* for the past few months. For context, my anxiety typically focuses on health/longevity; every year it's the fear of some new illness that haunts me perpetually. A few years ago, I was worried that my heart would give out, after that I was concerned that I had muscular dystrophy, and soon after that, I thought that I had some kind of fatal food-borne sickness. Usually I sob when I think that I have these diseases, believe fully that my death is imminent, and then ruminate on it day in, day out, until I manage to forget what I was ever worried about to begin with. Also for important context, these fears often manifest during/immediately before important milestones for me. Right now, I'm on the verge of graduating from undergrad and moving onto graduate school. 

This last year of undergrad has not been easy, either. Unfortunately, this semester, I've been saddled with one of the most rigid, strict, and impersonal professors in my department, and he has not gone easy on me. I've also taken on a job with strenuous hours that absorbs much of the time that I once used for classwork, and leaves me at a disadvantage compared to my peers--my supervisor at this job isn't much better than the professor that I just described. Immediately after my first class with this professor, and after my first shift with this supervisor, I began to panic about my GPA; what if my shifts prevented me from doing important work on my essays, which would inhibit my ability to perform well in my classes? What if my professor--who is open in his dislike of me--more harshly grades my work compared to my classmates? I fretted about my academic success in these more realistic (although, still anxiety-induced) regards, and shortly after I started to worry about potential cognitive issues that would hurt my chances of doing well in school/at my job, too. I started to fear that I might contract, or have already contracted, brain cancer which would prohibit me from finishing undergrad and moving onto grad school. Then I began to worry that I might have dementia, and that I would forget course material and suffer on my quizzes and exams. At first, these fears were just, well, fears--they were limited in scope to my thoughts. Eventually, though, I started to experience very real ""symptoms"" of these diseases that I was concerned about (no doubt influenced by my looking at WebMD and Healthline). I felt like I was becoming more inarticulate, and that I was struggling to string together coherent sentences. I feel, even as I'm typing this post out, like every word is a struggle to write. I also have struggled to remember things, and often my day feels akin to navigating through a haze. Weirdly enough, I've also been experiencing phantom smells (randomly smell smoke at peak moments of anxiety). It feels, essentially, like these illnesses that I've obsessed over for so long are coming to fruition. 

Naturally, these concerns of mine are not realistic. I'm in my early twenties, recently visited to the doctor over the summer for a physical (which I passed with flying colors), and these symptoms were only brought on after my anxiety reached its zenith earlier in the year. Despite this, I've been unable to convince myself that I'm okay, and it's beginning to concern not only me, but my family, too. My parents are both concerned for my wellbeing, and have asked me if I'd like to return to therapy or visit the doctor again to discuss strategies for dealing with my anxiety (I used to go to therapy, but arrogantly have tried to ""rawdog"" it for the past two years, to little success). I'm tempted by this, but am going to give myself to the end of the week to see if I can figure out strategies on my own to cope with these clearly unrealistic fears. In doing this, I wanted to consult you all; I've been a longtime lurker on this subreddit, and your advice to others has always helped me. This time, I want to see what you have to suggest for *me* specifically, lest I continue to spiral aimlessly into the abyss of my own mental illnesses. I know that might sound edgy--and I guess that it kind of is--but it's truly how I'm feeling right now. I'm at my lowest, and I really might not make it to graduate school as a result of my *anxiety*, not brain cancer or whatever other frivolous concern I find myself riddled with.

1lm7lqv,Anxiety,Fear of getting dementia,"Hello I'm 28 and I just read an article that people who suffer from chronic anxiety are more likely to develop dementia...

I had two grandparents who developed it at 78+ and I genuinely do no want to have it at any point.

My anxiety is off the roof. My anxiety is really bad and it has been like that since I remember, getting increasingly worse since 2019 when I discovered I had OCD. Between 2019 and 2021 I cried everyday, couldn't leave the bed, was panicking all the time due to intrusive thoughts.

Then I relapsed again in 2023 with a new ocd of health anxiety. It isn't as bad as the first mentioned relapse but for 2 weeks I thought I was going to die to due the concussion I suffered (which according to the doctors if I did have one was super mild). I could feel a brain leak so I believed I was going to pass away...(All I my head) To the point I had a panic attack so severe, that my body starting shaking uncontrollably for a few seconds (I thought I had epilepsy attack due to that - it was an odd experience... I wish I never had the ""concussion"" it triggered my relapse.

This was just to illustrate how bad my anxiety is... Everyday I think I have cancer and I'm going to die... I'm always anxious.

I'm so scared this is hurting my brain and that I am going to develop dementia... I'm genuinely scared....

1l6sg78,Anxiety,I hadn't gotten any medical attention from a migraine that lasted for an entire month and now I'm worried about Dementia,"I've had a headache since early of may or possibly even earlier than that and I kept asking my parents to take me to a clinic or a hospital because I've been having this headache where the pain ranges from mild to moderate. Yet they kept ignoring me and denying me and even get mad at me for asking even though I've been in chronic pain for more than 72 hours which is the normal time range for a migraine.

Not just a migraine but I've also been having other issues as well such as a left lip that feels pulled, numbness and weakness in my body, pain in my jaw, my left eye twitching, slight slurring and not to mention brain fog.

When I searched about it I learned that they could possibly be a sign of a silent stroke which is a stroke that occurs that causes less damage than a silent stroke but less likely to be noticed which as a result is just as bad as a regular stroke if not worse. And the consequences of it being untreated is an increased risk of more strokes and even vascular dementia.

I literally showed about this potential issue to my parents and surprise surprise they denied me yet again and say that I'm a negative thinker even though my pain is clear because there's no possible way I could have gotten a prolonged migraine and have that be normal. It's not.

Not to mention I've noticed my brain getting weaker and at one point I confused my mother and my mother's friend even though they're wearing different clothing, pressing the wrong icons multiple times and even misspelled words that are easy.

I mean I can still walk, talk, remember and think but seeing those issues have me worrying, especially since it's been a month since I have gotten checked.

And mind you in 19 years old, still live with my parents and have no finances of my own. I could have gotten help myself but I don't have the money nor do I have anyone around me who can actually understand my situation.

And yes I do know that I have OCD and Health Anxiety but these issues especially a long headache shouldn't be ignored.

Now I'm scared because I feel like my brain is destroying itself and no one is even bothering to help. I know that in probably just overreacting because the chances of getting Dementia at my age is very very low (as in 2-8%) but having it low doesn't mean it's 0, especially with what I am feeling right now.

I don't want to end up like that, I still have so much to live for. I wanted to get help but nobody is willing to lend a hand because unless I can't walk or talk anymore, they'll just assume that I'm overreacting. Especially since I'm young.

1ju1o7t,Anxiety,OCD memory loss,"I've posted in here before, but I'm doing it again. I was diagnosed with OCD last week, and my therapist is attempting to implement ACT into my treatment. My obsession? Memory loss. This started about two months ago when I was already dealing with heightened anxiety from the fear of time going by fast and not knowing what I want to do with my life. I'm 24 (F) and moved into my first real apartment in late September. Currently a server to make money, but I know I can't do this forever. For a long time I've stressed about what my passions are in life and not knowing what I want to do with it. Around January these anxieties really started picking up and I noticed I was experiencing feelings of DPDR (existential ocd type thinking) around the same time. I've dealt with these thoughts before and was medicated for quite some time until I felt like I no longer needed my SSRI (last April I'd day). As my anxieties started ramping, I had a full on panic attack when I realized I couldn't recall the specifics on how I stopped taking my meds. Like I know I did stop, but did I talk to my psych first, tapper off?, I couldn't tell immediately and then started to full on panic that I couldn't recall. Since then (early Feb.) I'm in my head all day having random memories play in my head and attempting to put those memories on my timeline (when I can't I panic). Working a a server, I'm fearful to see anyone because I'm scared I don't remember what we last discussed or the last time I saw them. I know I've watched shows and movies, but I don't remember with who or when. My boyfriend remembers so much of his past and when I try to test myself to see if I can remember the same, I seem I can't. Anyone or anything seems to trigger my brain to try and remember any memory connected. Sometimes I recall, but mostly I don't. 

My compulsions seem to be symptom searching that I don't have some form of permanent brain damage impacting memory (find relief when people say it's just anxiety and that it can be fixed), asking friends about memories and testing them to see if they remember, and bringing up random ass memories to try and get others to say ""wow, good memory."" Because in all honesty, my memory has in fact declined. I don't recall ever having poor memory, but now it seems to be GLARING (like gaps in my long term not so much short term). 

Throwing this out here as I'm looking for relatability and how to actually accept that I might have irreversible brain damage because honestly how tf am I supposed to come to terms with that. Also, how do I heal? My therapist talks a lot about acceptance and just noticing thoughts, but I'm struggling to grasp that concept. 

Been to a doctor all my labs are fine. Pretty much begged the man for a brain scan so I'm getting that done this week. I'm having a sleep study because my sleep isn't great as well. I'm considering quitting vaping nicotine bc I'm sure that doesn't help either. 

My psych prescribed my Prozac 10 MG as that's what I took when I dealt with DPDR and it helped completely, but I'm scared this is a whole different animal and I'm scared my Prozac maybe caused gaps in my memory.

1khjw49,Anxiety,HUGE list of anxiety symptoms to (hopefully) put you at ease. (Trigger warning),"**Cardiovascular symptoms** are the most common symptoms of anxiety. These symptoms include a fast/racing heart, shortness of breath, chest pain and/or tightness, air hunger (having a hard time getting a full, or satisfying breath), and heart palpitations (irregular heart beat, fluttering, pounding, or feeling like your heart is skipping a beat). Remember, if you had a sick heart, you'd feel symptoms 24/7, and they wouldn't stop when you're distracted. Your heart is way stronger than you think, and can sustain a lot.

**Gastrointestinal symptoms** are also extremely common with anxiety, chances are if you have an anxiety disorder, you've likely had some sort of GI issues, whether it be temporary, or long lasting. These symptoms include feeling a sudden urge to pass a bowel movement, constipation, diarrhea or loose stools, abdominal cramping, bloating and excessive gas, nausea, vomiting, appetite changes such as a decreased or increased appetite, belching, and morning sickness. Sometimes anxiety can even contribute to GI disorders such as IBS.

**Dizziness** is a very scary symptom of anxiety, but again, very common. These symptoms include vertigo, tunnel vision, loss of balance or trouble balancing, ""jelly legs"" (weakness or trembling in the legs), vision changes such as floaters, blurry vision,  and light sensitivity.

**Changes in body temperature.** These symptoms include hot/cold flashes, facial flushing, a burning sensation, feeling like your scalp is burning, chills, cold sweats, excessive sweating, sweaty palms and/or feet, and even a low grade fever.

**Overactive bladder symptoms.** These symptoms aren't often talked about, but also surprisingly common. These symptoms include frequent urination, an urgency to urinate (even if you don't need to), bladder incontinence. This happens because anxiety also causes muscle tension, which also effects the bladder.

**Reproductive symptoms** are symptoms that are often less discussed with anxiety, and typically only happen with prolonged, unmanaged anxiety disorders, or chronic stress. For men, these symptoms include decreased sperm production quality, changes in libido, decreased sperm motility, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain. For women, symptoms include irregular periods (spotting between periods, skipped periods, prolonged bleeding), changes in PMS symptoms, difficulty conceiving, reduced fertility, changes in libido.

**Musculoskeletal symptoms.** These symptoms include muscle cramps, muscle tension, muscle spasms, and muscle fatigue, and muscle stiffness. These symptoms can be all over your body, however they're most commonly in your legs, back, neck, and shoulders.

**Dissociation.** Dissociation is a common mental symptom of anxiety. This is your brain's way of protecting you from intense emotional stress. Symptoms of dissociation are feeling like you're in a dream, feeling like your body doesn't belong to you, light sensitivity, blurred vision, memory loss, feeling like your surroundings aren't real, altered sense of time, emotional numbness, deja vu, feeling like objects are much farther or much closer than they really are.

**Other mental illnesses** such as panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, depression, phobias, substance use disorders, and in rare cases, anxiety can be an early sign of schizophrenia.

**Impending doom** is an overwhelming feeling of dread, feeling as if something life threatening or tragic may happen, feeling an urgency to seek immediate medical care. Impending doom is a micro delusion, and you may feel as though you keep seeing ""signs"" that something terrible or tragic may happen to either you, or a loved one.

**Other mental symptoms** include brain fog, memory issues, irritability, mood swings, obsessive, violent, racing, or scary thoughts, paranoia, hallucinations, nightmares, nocturnal panic attacks, and confusion.

**Other symptoms.** Severe issues may occur due to prolonged, unmanaged anxiety (usually many years later), such as weakened immune system, heart issues, digestive disorders, chronic pain, sleep disorders, and hormonal imbalances.

**(UPDATE): There are also MANY OTHER SYMPTOMS that aren't discussed on this list. I've made this list based on my own experiences, other people's experiences, and my own research. If you suspect you have an anxiety disorder, I highly recommend researching its symptoms, and its effects on the mind and body. Anxiety is way more than just fear.**

You're not alone in any of this. Anxiety can be a huge, scary disorder. Make sure to take care of yourself and your health, both physically and mentally.

aptgc0,depression,(Update) I have an IBD. This changes everything.,"So I posted about two weeks ago asking everyone how they dealt with missing school. I got some great responses and assumed I would be back at school soon. Now I won‚Äôt. I have a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Either Crohn‚Äôs or Ulcerative Colitis. So I won‚Äôt be able to lay in bed all day and eat chips to survive because chips can land me in a hospital with my fourth blood transfusion. I can‚Äôt sit on the couch all day because moving can help the pain go away. I can‚Äôt just go back to school and shrug it off, I‚Äôve been gone for a month. I am getting a 504 plan for my needs (snacks, elevator, wheelchair, bathroom, etc.) but I will be doing half days of school because that amount of walking pains me.

1kv0z99,depression,Does Hrt or the pill help u,"Was wondering if hrt or the pill help others ? 
I know the pill can worsen symptoms. 
(Late 20s) 

I have had meno range hormones before and been on hrt and felt they helped somewhat. 
But went off to see if body could produce again normally since treatment was supposed to be only short and had surgery for ibd and that helped hormones now they out of meno but still on low side‚Ä¶. Seeing someone for it and they leaving it up to me. 
They said hrt is better than the pill but they all come with risks. 

Guess am worried cause I normally always get the side effects and odd reactions. 

Just depression n anxiety is playing up and can‚Äôt take any anti depressants as I‚Äôve tried near all they don‚Äôt work or I have severe reactions too. 

So just seeing if anyone is out there that has or been on pill and or hrt and how it went. 

Thanks

Just wondering if anyone has tried Hrt and it‚Äôs helped their depression / anxiety. 

I‚Äôm 29 
Have IBD and used to have such low hormones near meno and progesterone was meno levels so got put on hrt and it helped my sleep n anxiety n night sweats n thoight skin was better. 
Since IBD is improving got taken off it and been awhile since had it Thu my hormone levels are now good they say I don‚Äôt need pills but it still in lower good range however they will still give me pills if I want. However concerned about chance of cancer and starting again only at 29 I know I‚Äôm not young but young for hrt. On other hand I have noticed my skin more dry and loose could be due to losing some weight, also noticing headaches and not sleeping well and night sweats and thought if it helped somewhat that would be amazing n it would only be a lose dose.  
Other than that it‚Äôs birth control but have heard that‚Äôs worse for depression. 

I know my symptoms can be related to anxiety and depression too.

1f7frrv,depression,"Spouse is reaching a breaking point, idk what to do","My (37M) partner (33NB) has been going through hell lately. For some background - we've been together for 13 years, married for 8. We both deal with depression, but my partner deals with additional diagnoses including autism, anxiety, and PTSD. 

We met in college, and while I've gone on to have a fairly successful career, they've struggled immensely to find and hold work. They've accrued a fair amount of student loan debt that they can't pay back and it has fallen to me to pay. I've never had an issue with that, and I've always expected to pay at least some amount of it. We moved away from our home state to get away from abusive members of their family just before we got married, and we never managed to establish a strong social circle after relocation, and Covid exacerbated our isolation, and my partner has never come out of their Covid-anxiety, so we pretty much never go anywhere, and they struggle to even go into stores masked.

They have multiple degrees in multiple fields. Every time they've gotten a degree they've either gotten a job and not been able to hold it for a variety of reasons, or they've just not been able to find work at all because of our location not really having the right job availability for the field. They've also developed physical health issues over the years which has made it even harder, because they can't realistically hold a lot of in-person jobs. It's not technically diagnosed, but it's some form of IBD, which runs in the family.

There's been an ongoing, downward spiral where they seem to expect other people to find them a career path and a job now. And every attempt to help seems to be met with refusal. They

All of this has just kind of...broken them. Lately they've become so angry and bitter about it they've started to take it out on me. Last night they just left telling me to promise to take care of our pets, and with little money and nowhere to go, and I truly thought the next call I was going to get was to identify a body. Eventually they started sending me messages, but they were refusing any help, and refusing to say where they were. I stayed up all night talking with them, but they were so angry. They told me they hated me and they wanted me and everyone to suffer like them. At 6:30am they finally decided to come home and told me just to leave them alone. They also tend to try and put words in my mouth like""if you don't have an answer to fix my problem you're telling me I'm worthless."" I know it's largely the depression talking, but episodes like this keep happening where they shut down for days at a time and wall everyone off. It feels like each time is worse. It also feels to me like they're trying to make me hate them, for reasons I can only speculate about.

I want to help with the work situation by paying for new certifications, but they're so expensive and my partner refuses to accept more monetary help over maybe a few thousand dollars. ""I don't want your wretched money"" they told me last night.

They seem like they they're at a breaking point, and I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point too. Just trying to work my job and take care of our animals and get through the day is hard enough for me and I don't know how to handle this anymore. I don't know if I should break things off or if that's just me being insensitive and abandoning them. They have nowhere else to go, and I also kind of have nowhere else to go, since I'm the one who cares for all of our animals. I finally cracked and called my mom to vent about it because I've been dealing with this alone for so, so long.

I'm trying to maintain my own peace as best as I can, but I feel like it's getting to a point where my attempts at maintaining my own sanity is seen as abandonment, or not caring. I truly feel like they need to be responsible for their own happiness, and I've made reasonable attempts to help, but they're so resistant to help.

The feels like a disorganized rant, but then again I only got like 3 hours of sleep last night due to all of this, and I'm recapping the most recent part of like 13 years of history, so I'll try to answer any questions. I don't use Reddit a lot so I apologize if I'm slow to respond but I'll try to get back here ASAP.

2c1flz,depression,Loneliness is so painful,"I don't think this will get many views if at all but I feel I need to put this somewhere. I don't even know what I'm going on about as I'm writing this on my phone rather than getting up and typing it to be more legible on my computer.

I've been dealing with a lot of issues that when I see other posts here makes me think ""I'm not as bad as that person"" or ""maybe I am fine"" but the problem is I don't ever feel like I'm fine, I feel the opposite more times than not.

I have Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia to the point of having no eye brows nor eyelashes (you don't notice how something as small as hair above your eyes can shatter your confidence until it isn't there anymore). 

I have been bouncing around on meds to treat the IBD and arthritis for the better part of 4 years now with nothing helping, in fact the symptoms have worsened to the point where I am classified as disabled. 

I am getting to the point where it feels like the best way to deal with everything is to just disappear from life. I'd like to say that my actual health is what really has me so down but the loneliness that I always feel throughout every moment of every day is so agonizingly painful that it makes the arthritic pain feel almost like a pleasure in comparison. I've been lonely for a while, but there was always something I could do to get around it, school, extracurricular activities, something. 

Having nothing to do just really makes me look at the people I went to school with, the people I was friends with, the ""Facebook"" friends of mine all going on being so happy finding purpose in something, in someone... I feel jealous. I don't know if that's even the right word. I guess I'm just really more lonely than I thought.

I don't know how to deal with this anymore. I hate always feeling alone, having to put on a mask when I do hang out on the days my joints actually do let me maneuver about. 

Even when I go out I feel so awkward due to having no brows that it feels as if I am constantly getting stared at. I wish I had some kind of remedy to just stop feeling so down

kwu8lq,depression,"Eying up my anti-depressant bottle right now, thinking about taking all of them and hope that I fall into a coma and die peacefully. Fucking sick of this.","I'll start with school. I'm 15, turning 16 this June. I'm a sophomore. I'm failing one of my classes. This is devastating for me because currently my only goal in life is to please my parents, and they expect nothing lower than a B. This is especially frustrating because I got really good scores on my PSAT this year and have a high iq, but still am failing honors chem. I know that it's a hard class, but I appealed for it so I'm worried that that will make me look bad when I start to apply to colleges. Last year, my parents got separated and still are. Before this, I could not try in school and get straight A's. Fuck around in class, do homework during lunch etc. but still get straight A's. I even was able to do this in the first half of 9th grade, and then my parents split, and I've been struggling to get B's and C's in school. I don't know what happened, I started to try harder, and the harder that I tried, the worse the grade I would get. I was born into a wealthy family, won't say how rich but we are within the top 1%. Since my parents are so successful, they expect me to be even more successful and go to a very good college and have a very good career and make a lot of money. But, I am now struggling in school so I feel like I am letting them down.

Now on to my medical conditions, nothing severe, but enough to make my life feel like hell. Since 5th grade, I've had constant headaches, I mean non-stop for YEARS. NOTHING fixed it, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, nothing. Now, the only thing that fixes it is Topamax, but I can only take 3 in a week, and no more than 12 in a month. Topamax only helps for a few hours and then the headache comes back, just as strong. Now every night, I use a device on my forehead made by a company called Cefaly. It uses electrodes or something to stimulate my nerves. This device makes my headache worse for a few hours, but then it goes away for an hour or two, but this doesn't help me at all because by the time that I wake up, the headache is back. I have TMJ which may be causing this but I also have ear pain on the other side of my head. I have intense pressure behind my eyes. I have pain in the back of my head. I also have IBS and IBD. I am either diarrheal or constipated, no in between. The constipation can become so bad that I physically can't move, my body just won't move. Or, I'll just shit myself without even knowing that I have to go to the bathroom. I am depressed and anxious. 

Depression. I cut myself on my forearms last year for about 2-3 months. I was then sent in an outpatient center, I hated it so much that I stopped cutting. haha i guess it worked then. I want to die, but I don't want to kill myself. I have seriously considered OD-ing on my anti-depressant several times, this is due to the constant stress that I am under and the constant pain that I am in.

Friends. I haven't spoken to my irl friends in almost a year now due to covid. The friends that I play online with are suicidal and drug addicts. (They live in a state where it's legal and are mid-30s or something so it's legal). Listening to them talk about them being suicidal makes me not want to kill myself because I don't want them to kill themselves because I stopped talking to them or whatever. I don't know, probably makes me sound like I have a big ego but that's what I think. It's depressing to hear this because this used to be my only source of enjoyment. 

I've played the piano for around 12 years. I study with a world-class piano player. I feel like I'm wasting his time. I feel like I'm not good enough to study with him, but my dad wants me to so I feel like I can't say anything. Ever since my parents split, I've lost all enjoyment from playing the piano. I haven't made any progress since they split. It feels like everything in my life is the fault of my parents splitting, but I'm probably wrong as usual. It's hard as fuck to practice on two different pianos, then go to my teachers house and play on a different one. I should be used to the two that aren't at my dad's but they still feel foreign after a year+ of playing on them. Piano is my dad's pride and joy, and I've been pressured to do it my entire life and I feel like if I quit then I won't be living up to my dad's expectations.

Therapist. I've been going through therapists like crazy, but I thought that I had finally found one. But ever since we started to do online visits, he just tells me the same thing over and over again and it's just making me angry. He constantly says ""You're not broken"" ""It's normal to feel this way"", like holy shit I knew that after the first time you said it. I just feel like I can't talk to him, but I don't want to find another because he's a really nice guy and I don't want to make him feel like he couldn't help.

My grandparents are likely to die soon, and I can't just visit them even if there was no covid. My dad's side lives in Texas, (I live in the north east of the US) and my mom's side is scattered around Germany. My mom's mother broke both of her hips and has covid and is in critical condition right now. My mom's step-mom died from breast cancer last year, my dad's step-mother is in a nursing home, about to turn 100 this month. Covid just got into the nursing home. Several years ago, I was visiting my mom's brother (he smoked 2 packs a day and drank like a case of bear a day), he was an artist. Not a successful one, but he made some decent paintings. He lived in a small apartment, one or two rooms is all that I can remember. I remember that he had a small trampoline in one room, and he was in another, on his bed, hooked up to all sorts of things. I was playing on that trampoline while my mother and my uncle's girlfriends watched him die. I was fucking having fun playing on a trampoline while my uncle died less than 5 feet from me.

1kkm7v5,depression,Depression Sucks,"First of all I have a long post. Feel free to skip if you do not feel like reading right now.

I don‚Äôt really know where else to begin than at the start. On thanksgiving 2023, my wife was pregnant. We also have two other children. I work as a firefighter/paramedic and on the drive from our home to my MIL I began to feel sick. I spent the entire thanksgiving with fevers and it progressively got worse.  When we left it got to the point where breathing was hard so we went to the ER. I was diagnosed with influenza A and while it isn‚Äôt that dangerous of an illness it was a pretty bad one for me this time.  

Anyways, I passed it to my wife and after five days of coughing aggressively and feeling in the dumps she woke up to the entire bed covered in blood.  My first impression was she miscarried. After getting things cleaned up we went to the ER again and she was told she had a hematoma but the baby was fine. This happened at 12 weeks gestation. 

She continued to bleed every day for the next 9 weeks. She was in and out of doctors offices and was eventually diagnosed with marginal placenta separation.  At 21 weeks and 5 days gestation her water broke and the doctor at the hospital sent us home and told us to prepare for a still born.  I decided to take her to another hospital that was near where I worked and was a children‚Äôs hospital where they admitted her. 

At 22 weeks and 2 days gestation, my wife was rushed in for an emergency cesarean section due to the baby‚Äôs heart rate dropping.  She gave birth to my son who weighed 1lb 4oz and was 11 3/4 inches long.  We spent 176 days in the NICU during this time.

When my son was born I took a leave of absence from my job to be there for my wife and kids.  My wife stayed at the NICU while I took care of the day to day with the other kids. In August my son was discharged from the NICU on some oxygen and a feeding tube.  Nothing we couldn‚Äôt handle.

Well in January my son contracted human metapnuemo virus and RSV. This required a hospital visit and they admitted him on January 10th. On January 17th they had to intubate him and put him on a ventilator.  We have now been in the PICU since January 10th and we‚Äôre just told that they don‚Äôt expect us to be out before the end of the year.

He is still on a ventilator, has a tracheostomy, g/j tube now, a broviac catheter for vascular access, and we were just told after he had to have eye surgery that his eye disease is the worst the surgeon has ever seen and that he will eventually go totally blind.

This whole time I have fought with my depression. I am very familiar with the darkness (I am a combat veteran who fought out of alcoholism and depression before). This depression this time is so intense though. I have gained nearly 80 pounds in the last 15 months, I have found myself lacking basic hygiene like brushing my teeth or forgetting to put deodorant on. I have always been a physically fit person and hygiene has always been important to me. 

I sit here and think that I am just watching my son fight a losing battle and that he is slowly dying on me. I am assured by the doctors that that is not the case but I can‚Äôt help but think that. I have shutoff from my wife and have watched here grieve in silence as she just thinks I am an emotionless asshole but the whole time I am crying inside. I know I will get through this and by acknowledging I am depressed I can finally begin to climb out of this hole.

I have been going back to grief counseling for the past month and I have spoke to my wife during that time as well.  We are working through it but man sometimes there are things I just can‚Äôt say to her about my feelings.

tix4f4,depression,I feel like an absolute liar and fraud for having Crohn's Disease when I'm not losing weight.,"TW: Eating disorders and weight discussion

I haven't read the number on the scale in a long time since I know it would spiral me into another huge relapse. I've had Crohns for about eight years now. Naturally, I joined r/crohns for support. I always felt dirty and alone. I was hopeful that I'd feel support there, or at least some sense of belonging.

Welp.

I see post after post about people complaining about how they can't put any weight on, no matter how much they eat or drink. Don't get me wrong, I feel terribly for them, and I can't imagine how they feel. But it makes me feel like a fucking whale. I don't seem to be getting any skinnier. I eat at little as possible, maybe a pack of crackers or two, yet I'm still fucking enormous. Every time I see the stretch marks on my legs, I wish I was dead. Every time I'm in the shower, the sight of my own body makes me want to puke.

I'm so fucking ugly and disgusting. When I look at my boyfriend, I feel sorry for him. I feel terrible that he has to be with such a revolting excuse for a woman. I'm so close to leaving the crohns subreddit due to being a failure. I have to suffer through daily pain and sickness, and I can't even at least have one symptom I would actually want!?

I won't ever go to an actual support group. I'm too fat. I often wonder if I even have Crohns. I'm honestly thinking of stopping my medication because what's even the point? At least if I'm sick enough, I won't want to shovel food into my disgusting gullet. If I get hospitalized, then hell, maybe even better! I'm a waste of life already. I have nothing to offer the world but my looks. That's something I could actually change. If I can't be smart or fun or good-natured or talented, maybe I could at least be pretty. If not in the face, then maybe in my figure. 

But again, probably not. I'm a gluttonous freak. There's no point. I'll never be skinny enough for anything. Not for beauty, not for being ""properly"" sick, not for a single goddamn thing. I wonder why my stupid brain even bothers to produce all of this self hatred when I'm so ugly to begin with.

No one gets what it‚Äôs like to have lupus. No one gets the hell I went through to try and keep up but I couldn‚Äôt .... only up side is that I‚Äôm healthier now but I mean.....

4aecud,depression,"Female in her mid 40's with Crohns, feeling 90 yrs old and unmotivated","I am undiagnosed, but have the symptoms.  I am not suicidal.

For the past year, since moving to a small town with not much happening during the day, I've been slowly increasing my internet time to almost every waking minute.

I plan activities, I go work out with friends at least two mornings a week (I try for four but shit happens), and I go for craft classes (that cost $25 a class, which I don't really have the money for) and I have the odd outing with my family, but other than this, I am on my computer, just aimlessly, unproductively browsing or facebooking or redditing.

I am in my mid 40's, married (good marriage) with two young children at home (elementary school aged).  I feel they are missing out because I'm always lying in bed, on my iPad.

I have Crohns disease, which makes it easier to have blah days where I just stay in bed.  I would love to go for walks, but I would only end up shitting my pants in the middle of the sidewalk, which you can imagine, isn't pleasant.

I have some motivation, but it's difficult to follow through.  Often I feel I'm just being f-ing lazy, and have no excuse for not just getting off my ass and going to do something.

I stress that I'm not suicidal, but I do feel that I'm prematurely old, does that make sense?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4aecud/female_in_her_mid_40s_with_crohns_feeling_90_yrs/,1457980012.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1hd0r1q,depression,One step away from suicide ,"
Hi guys. My name is Jonas, I'm 24 years old and I've decided to get my current situation off my chest. To do this, I need to go back in time and tell you a bit about my story.

It all started in 2013, when I was 13. During a visit to a friend's house, I had my first contact with pornography. Unfortunately, this turned out to be one of the biggest problems in my life, creating an addiction that I still carry with me today. If I had known the damage it would cause, I would never have exposed myself to such content.

Over the years, the addiction got worse. I started consuming more and more extreme content, which affected my mental health: I developed a lack of motivation, anxiety, paranoia and, eventually, depression. My brain became dependent on dopamine, and in 2017, already badly damaged, I entered an IT course. Despite being one of the best students, my depression was at an all-time high, because what I really wanted was to pursue a career in the military. However, due to my weakened body and lack of motivation, I ended up going into an area I never wanted to.

After graduating in 2019, I tried to get a job in IT. I even got recommendations from my teacher, but unfortunately I didn't succeed. My city doesn't offer many opportunities in this field either. I then went to college to study Systems Analysis and Development, but due to depression, I dropped out on the first day.

With college out of the way, I decided to study programming at home and try my hand at public exams - some due to pressure from my family, others on my own initiative. However, with the market becoming increasingly competitive and my motivation falling, I was unable to achieve any of my goals.

In 2023, already at a loss, I began to question my own will to live. I prayed to God to take my life. My relationship with my parents deteriorated; they thought I was lazy, that I didn't want to work. My brother also distanced himself from me for this reason. There were constant arguments at home and I felt more and more like giving up.

Still in 2023, due to family pressure, I went back to college to study Systems Analysis and Development, now in distance learning. I did this to avoid further conflicts and to try to improve my relationship with my brother. However, I knew I couldn't complete the course, as my motivation was already non-existent. I started lying to my family, saying that I was studying. The stress of this lie was so great that my physical health began to crumble.

I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, a serious condition which, if left untreated, can lead to fatal complications such as intestinal cancer. I also developed gastritis, reflux and kidney stones, one of which is 1 cm and causes me constant pain. Colitis forces me to go to the toilet up to six times a day, and the other problems make my life a daily misery.

Despite all these difficulties, I still dream of working and helping my family. I've applied for jobs as a pharmacy clerk, supermarket clerk and office assistant, but so far I haven't been able to get anything. With so many health problems and a lack of motivation, I feel that my chances are getting slimmer and slimmer.

Today, I feel that when my father dies, I will probably take my own life. I don't want to be a burden on my family or depend on my siblings. The arguments with my parents continue, and they insist that my health problems are no excuse for not working. This hurts me deeply, because I feel like I'm trying, even with so many limitations.

What hurts the most is trying to fight it all and still being accused of not making an effort. Every time I hear that, my desire to give up only increases.

1cyeknd,depression,Depression sucks,"Hi, I'm 19 years old and I'm depressed, or at least I think I am. I moved to the U.S. 3 years ago from Sweden, and ever since then, my sanity has been fading away slightly every day.

My first issue was having to forcefully leave behind 15 years worth of experiences to come to the U.S. I had no friends and wouldn‚Äôt make any anytime soon. I was very shy, and it didn‚Äôt help that this was a new country with a new system and a language I wasn‚Äôt the best in. I would only get friends two years later, but even then, I only had friends in my last period class, and the rest of the time was boring.

My second issue is how not only is school like hell, but so is home life. There is almost always a disagreement between someone in the family, and I'm always expected to resolve it. My mom constantly argues with us, and my sister is spoiled and rebellious. When I say my mom constantly argues with us, I mean it. Once I had an empty bottle in my room, and my mom got so mad that I hadn‚Äôt cleaned it up yet she took my phone and laptop. When I said I needed them for my homework, she called me a liar. It was so bad that I genuinely liked school in Sweden more than being at home. But now my school life is also bad.

My third issue is that I'm a very unlucky guy. The stuff that has happened to me is something else. Not only was I forced to leave Sweden because ‚Äúwe have no family members in Sweden, and in the U.S., we do,‚Äù but then when we arrived, not only were most of them douches behind our backs, my grandma kicked us out of the house because she remembered she wanted to sell it. This was when we were in her house, and she was one of the main reasons we came because she said she would help us with money and a place to stay. I also got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and it got worse, especially in school where it would feel like I‚Äôd been shot in the stomach if I didn‚Äôt go to the bathroom, which was almost every period. I applied to Sam‚Äôs Club and got a very good position and offer, but the system is failing to send me a background check. Even after five weeks of my manager trying, she keeps failing to get it fixed.

That was some background; now let me explain the symptoms. (Edit: I forgot to mention that when I started college a year ago, I had to do it online because I had no car, which made my mental health that much worse because I was all alone for a year.)

I keep having thoughts in my head ruminating about how depressed I am, which makes it hard for me to focus on homework, games, movies, etc. Movies were the one thing keeping me happy. I can‚Äôt get excited about anything. I feel very lonely, and the only reason I haven‚Äôt gone mad is that I still talk to my friend from Sweden daily, which is different from having friends physically. I have two friends in the U.S., but both of them are always busy. I‚Äôve gotten very lazy, and whenever I don‚Äôt talk to anyone, I instantly get depressed, laying down in bed thinking of how I can change my life.

What am I doing to better myself? I‚Äôm looking for jobs to keep me occupied, but I just can‚Äôt get any offers. I‚Äôm going to the gym, which helps slightly. I‚Äôm trying to meditate every day, but it‚Äôs hard to focus.

Please give suggestions on what to do to improve my life.

196qchl,depression,"My wife left me about a year and a half ago, and I feel stuck...","I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this type of situation, but here's the story...

We were high school sweethearts, started dating our sophomore year, 2013. We got in trouble as teens do, doing things at school that shouldn't be done there. Of course her parents weren't thrilled about that, so they forbade her to see me. We kept it going through more dumb decisions that we thought were necessary at the time. She battled depression through it all because of her parent's overreaction. We went through a lot during our first few years together, but I loved her more than anything in the world, and I thought she loved me too. Which I have no doubt at the time she did. I proposed to her February 12th 2016, when we were both seniors after her parents finally let her go on dates with me in an official capacity. After graduation we moved in together, and started working together at various jobs. But we took another hit when she got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. She wasn't quite the same after that. Especially our sex life. But we got married in 2021, and I couldn't have been more happy than I was then. 

   Then it all fell apart that new years day 2022. An accusation came out against me with her family. Most of them were on my side about it, until a few months later. She ended up not knowing who to believe, and said that she didn't know how to get me out of this one, even though I didn't do anything.  She told me that to protect me, she needed to leave, and that she doesn't feel right with me anymore. Though when I asked her if she still loved me, she said she did but I'm not sure if that was the truth. She said she still cares about me, when there were times I was thinking about ending my pain for good. But I don't know if it was genuine, or trying to save face... She still had some things at my place to come pick up, so I got a storage unit to put them in. Last October, she came to get them and I went to let her in... But she wasn't alone... I felt even more betrayed than I was before... I don't know why I still love her after that, or how to even react/deal with that. I don't  even know  if my feelings are normal. I can honestly say that I'm stuck in the past, remembering the good times and wanting them back... Wanting the woman I fell in love with back... 

I don't even know how to date as an adult and she was the only real friend that I had, and seeing all the horror stories online about relationships these days has me scared, and hopeless. It's not like I don't want to move on, but it feels like there's giant ship anchor tied to me that I can't let go of. I'm not really sure what I want out of this post. There's a million things constantly going through my head... How do I even start moving on, more over, finding some one new? For an extrovert, I'm pretty shy... I don't know...

t9cy5r,depression,sertraline/Zoloft 50mg,"I was on sertraline/Zoloft 50mg for four years for depression. While I was on it, Premature Ejaculation (PE) pretty much went away. I realise now that it also numbed a lot of emotions and made me very fatigued (which I didn't understand why it was SO difficult, try as I might, to wake up... that it would create issues at work as I was a single guy noone to wake me up other than alarm etc).

Came off Sertraline at end of December 2021. Wanted to be clean of it. Had some withdrawal symptoms but got past them. After coming off I noticed changes in my sleeping for good and bad. For the good - I was now able to wake up easier; for the bad - getting to sleep takes much longer now and is ridden with anxiety too, lots of shaking and so on and overthinking about everything. I've also been getting intensely emotional about things, they're triggering me a lot more, even my housemate's noticed it. I have a concomitant digestive condition called Ulcerative Colitis (UC) which, if you aren't familiar, is similar to Crohn's in many respects. It's very stress-related and makes it flare up. So, since coming off the sertraline, stress levels and anxiety went up, so I'm now at the beginning of experiencing a flare up to my UC.

Also, the PE came back and also intense anxiety. Like to the point I'm now scoring 17 on the depression scale now! Worst it's ever been. 

I'm trying to get an app't with the doctor to explain where I'm at with this... That I'm back on it (I still have it listed in my repeat prescriptions as I self-weaned off without talking to doc as couldn't get an appointment). The last couple of days I took 50mg when the anxiety got so bad.

So with reluctance, I think the way the Creator of the Universe has made me, requires this medication to stay able to cope with the world around me. I tried coming off it, wish I could, but my overactive mind will not allow me to do so. 

I was using weed a bit as a coping mechanism to escape but when smoking it it gave me a cough and I also don't like the inertia it creates within me, lack of zest. My housemate is a massive stoner and it pisses the hell out of me watching him just be a stoner around the house all day, tries to engage me in conversation to be nice but it's like he's from another planet asking inane questions that I've already told him a million times. I normally just say, 'ok, see you later,' and go.

I need to try to find a way to combat the side effects like the extreme fatigue and accept I'm probably on sertraline for life.

Based on the above I wonder when the best time to take the dose is for me... And I wanted to share my story and compare experiences with others on here.

14wd611,depression,Questions about a doctors visit,"I made a throw away account to post this. 

The short version is I asked my primary care physician today, if I happen to need a little time off of work either due to physical or mental problems would he write me a note. I am not trying to scam the system. I have a large amount of sick days accrued, however I can't use any for the next year. He said no, because everyone is stressed at work and if he wrote notes like that he would be writing them for everyone.  

The longer version now. I work overnights in a somewhat physically demanding job. I've been there about five years and just recently took a promotion. Because of the promotion I can't use sick time for the next year or I lose the promotion. Honestly that may be the best thing. Since I took the promotion I have been stressed out way more than I should be. Plus working overnights is terrible as it is. Many nights I go in, where try as I may, I don't get any sleep, especially since taking the promotion.

Other stress is from constant attacks about my crew not doing their work, however I literally can't do anything about that as I am ordered not to discipline anyone out of fear of losing them. It also doesn't help that we are running at only 50% of our crew. When hired, new people also can not call off more than a couple times in for the first year, so no one stays very long.  The few ""old timers"" can of course call in if they need to. 

I have had pretty bad anxiety all my life. I've also have depression too. I lost both parents recently and I am having a hard time with that. I don't have a wife or children for a support group either. I also have ulcerative colitis, probably from poor stress management. 

In the 35 years of working I have never once asked for any time off from any job. I've been working full time the last 33 years straight, so I don't really see myself as a shirker. Just lately things have been really rough. The stress and lack of sleep have been kicking my butt and is starting to manifest themselves in physical ways. Such as I feel the onset of a flare up of the ulcerative colitis for one. There are other things too, like feeling like I always have a permanent flu or something. 

I don't know what to do. I thought about just quitting but I need my health insurance. As for needing money, there is that, but after 35 years of working, much of it overtime too, I have quite a bit in savings, my house is paid off, and I have zero debt.  

I guess my question is this. The doctor made me feel like a baby for even suggesting that I'm reaching a breaking point. So am I just being a baby and I just need to suck it up?

zmzg5t,depression,I'm depressed and my stomach hurts!,"What if the answers do not lie in what is immensely large, but instead lie in what is infinitesimally small.  At the age of 10 I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, IBS, and ulcerative colitis.  Every time I went to the bathroom I experienced extreme cramping and would also pass dark colored blood.  I had noncancerous polyps removed from my colon on several occasions.  By the time I was 15 I was facing the distinct possibility that I would soon need a colostomy.  I was taking all kinds of drugs, from steroids to proton pump inhibitors to treat my stomach problems.  I was informed by a nutritionist that there was a possibility that by the time I was 25 I would need a G Tube due to all the scarring in my intestines from the continuing ulceration.  She said that my intestines would soon get to the point that they would no longer be able to absorb the vital nutrients that my body needed for survival and that without a G tube I would just waste away.

In my early 20‚Äôs I first learned of the brain gut connection.  In the walls of the digestive system there is a second brain called the ENS.  ENS stands for enteric nervous system.  The ENS is made up of two thin layers of more than 100 million cells lining the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the rectum.  This ENS can also control a person‚Äôs mood, and even the way a person thinks.  The ENS does have an effect on serotonin levels in the brain.  People with depression also usually have issues with their stomachs.  This is the point where my own connection and understanding of the ENS comes into effect.  I began to notice that when my stomach hurt I also felt depressed.  At time, I felt suicidal.  It made sense to me that if my stomach was hurting I would feel depressed, but I never thought that my hurting stomach might also be controlling my depression.  I soon learned that if I could get my stomach problems under control I might be able to end my depression and mood disorders.  At the time I was on Lithium and paxil for my depression.

The first thing I did was to change my diet.  I looked closely at foods that I called trigger foods that I noticed that soon after I ate them my stomach would hurt.  I eventually had to eliminate all alcohol, raw fruits and vegetables, red meat, spicy foods, acidic foods and drinks.  Once I did this my stomach immediately got better and my bipolar issues and depression began to go away.  The next thing I had to do was try and eliminate as much stress as I could.  I ended relationships with toxic people, I ended friendships and even a few romantic relationships.  I continued to get better.  To end stress at work I began to work only night shifts where there was less going on and more quietness.  In just a short time I was able to quit taking all my depression medication as well as the meds for my stomach.  

Now at 48, I have become a master at recognizing trigger foods and eliminating stress.  I refuse to be stressed at work or in relationships.  It may be drastic, but if there is too much stress at a job, I just quit and move on.  I only have one life, I can find another job.  The same is with relationships, if you are a toxic person I will walk away from you in an instance.  I am not alone, I am married and have a 10 year old daughter.  Our home is very quiet and calm, my wife and daughter are on the same page with me.  

I believe if you have depression look first at your stomach and see if you have issues there as well.  If you can learn to control your stomach you may begin to notice your depression ending as well.  I am 48, I am on no meds, I never needed a Gtube, I am happier at 48 then I was ever at 28.  Have I discovered a way to cure depression based on stomach problems? I do not know, but the last time I was at my doctor my doctor said that he could not even tell that I ever had crohons or IBS, or colitis.  I have seemingly completely cured my stomach issues.  If you experience similar issues to the ones I have, maybe if you do as I did, maybe you too could lead a happier and healthier life",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zmzg5t/im_depressed_and_my_stomach_hurts/,1671145955.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester.

It got much worse in 11th grade and especially senior year. Most mornings I wake up and want nothing more than to rot in bed all day.

I don‚Äôt have the motivation or aspirations I used to have anymore. When I think about doing schoolwork I get a guilty pit in my stomach and can‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

TW: mention of suicidal ideation & overdose 

I‚Äôve been depressed for a long time, but generally I am ‚Äòhigh functioning‚Äô. I feel numb and unmotivated but I can get things done and I don‚Äôt want to die. But last week I randomly had a panic attack in the morning. It wasn‚Äôt even a particularly bad panic attack. But I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack for about a year and it‚Äôs unlike me to have a panic attack for no reason, they are usually triggered by something. Ever since then, I have felt awful. The first two days after I cried a lot and I hardly ever cry. I felt extremely depressed and hopeless. I started to think about suicide. I looked a lot into fatal dosages of medications, and basically came up with a whole plan of how it would happen. I‚Äôve had periods of suicidal ideation before but I‚Äôve never made a plan before. I had to wait to get my prescription a few days, and luckily I don‚Äôt feel now how I did then. But I am extremely worried about how, seemingly out of nowhere, I can go from being okay to wanting to die. I don‚Äôt understand why the panic attack has triggered all of this. I suppose the randomness of it has made me feel out of control. But there have been periods in in my life where I have had panic attacks every day, have been unable to leave the house for months , and even then I didn‚Äôt feel that depressed. I‚Äôm seriously confused and concerned that this can happen out of the blue, and wondering if it‚Äôs  possible that the panic attack can affect part of my brain. I‚Äôm even wondering if maybe what I experienced was more similar to a seizure and it has damaged my brain. I feel so exhausted like times where I have fainted. Usually panic attacks cause me to feel extremely anxious but this time I just feel depressed. I think I‚Äôm starting to feel better but this experience has made me concerned that this could happen again in the future. If I hadn‚Äôt needed to wait to get medication things could have been a lot worse.

1lw7m46,depression,Panic attack medication,"Hey,
Somewhere in march I had my first panic attack - it happened at around 3 am. I just woke up and seconds later I got a panic attack, I was so scared for my life because I didn‚Äôt know what was happening to me but fortunately my friend who was present at the same place at the time ‚Äúreassured‚Äù me that it is a panic attack which somehow relaxed me even though it lasted about an hour.
I immediately decided to go to a psychiatrist but the earliest appointment was available for july 3rd this year so I waited. During this time I had some calming herb pills from the pharmacy that I took up until the visit. The first two weeks after the original attack were awful I was getting daily, less stronger panic attack throughout the day, I was scared to leave the house and go to sleep because I didn‚Äôt want to wake up to a panic attack. 2 weeks into May i finally started seeing improvement, I no longer feared to leave the house, even didn‚Äôt fear going to the shop or pharmacy and even was able to cycle and go for long walks. Managed to not have a panic attack since May first. The psychiatrist prescribed me venlafaxine 75mg that I am to up in dosage to 150mg in 2 days (5 days after starting taking 75mg) and then to 225mg after another 5 days. After the first day of taking the medicine my panic attacks returned, I had 3 on day 1, then I woke up at 2 am and felt heavy anxiety throughout the night, my chest was tight and I felt waves of cold hitting my body, I finally managed to fall asleep at 6 am. I contacted my psychiatrist and he prescribed me Xanax SR 1 mg for when the panic attacks happen but I haven‚Äôt taken it yet because I am scared that it will cause more panic attacks. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack for 2 days but I still feel anxiety and uneasiness alongside medication side effects such as huge lack of appetite - I eat half a bread-roll in the morning to take the medication and then when i feel slightly better in the evening whatever leftovers from the dinner I get, my pupils are dialated causing me to see weirdly and I feel out of this reality as if I looked at my surroundings but didn‚Äôt comprehend it. I wake up so many times throughout the night. My psychiatrist told me that the increase in panic attacks and anxiety is not uncommon in the starting days of taking medication for fighting panic attacks in the long run but I would like to know if someone had/has something similar and if the awful side effects eventually subside/stop. Because of them I am once again scared of everything, even to leave the house so I have to relearn everything once again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lw7m46/panic_attack_medication/,1752136691.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

lfrkrq,depression,I've been diagnosed with severe depression and moderate social anxiety. I've been dealing with the occasional panic attacks as well. I'm tired. I just want to be normal. I don't want to fight tooth and nail just to exist anymore.,"I'm surrounded by people yet I feel so fucking alone. I'm surrounded by hope and love and happiness and all I can think about is blowing my brains out. All I can see are my flaws. Being fat. Being lazy. Being a failure. Being a disappointment. Being alone. Being me. But what I hate the most is my tendency to self sabotage. Like eating junk when on a diet. Or staying up late or procrastinating. Or for example when I attempted to avoid a test by breaking my own arm.

I'm 19, and I've never even had a girlfriend. I've never held hands with a girl or had such a private, intimate relationship with someone that I could not hide behind anything. I know it's all my fault. Knowing this kills me. It frustrates me. I fucking hate it. What's worse is while I'm at work and I'm interacting with people, I've learned to adapt a mask. It helps me to manage to interact with people. I just imagine they aren't talking to me, but a normal functioning person.

It doesn't help when I later have a panic attack and I can't figure out why I can't just adopt this mask and be normal. Why I can't just... Stop being sad. Stop being alone. Stop being desperate. 

I hate myself. I hate what I need to do in order to function everyday. I hope I can one day just be free of it all. I know that it is likely to not happen.

1lhi2lh,depression,"16F, 5 yrs of chronic stress/anxiety, panic attacks & fainting. Haven‚Äôt slept or eaten properly in years. I need help.","Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a 16-year-old girl and I‚Äôm really struggling. I feel like I‚Äôve been under this cloud of stress and anxiety since I was around 9-11years, and it never really goes away. Every couple of years (usually 2) it flares up into an almost unbearable phase (last time I fainted at school and had regular panic attacks), but even on ‚Äúgood‚Äù days I still wrestle with a racing heart, and exhausting low energy. 

My current situation:

Sleep: School starts at 6 AM, so I need to be awake by 5am. I try to go to bed by 9 PM for an 8-hour night, but I usually don‚Äôt fall asleep until 10‚Äì11 PM, then wake up randomly several times, often lying awake for an hour. Over the last 5 years I‚Äôve averaged 5‚Äì6 hours of broken sleep nightly.

Daily routine: Wake at 5 AM ‚Üí school 6 AM‚Äì6 PM ‚Üí home around 7 PM ‚Üí eat/study/scroll reels until late. Weekends aren‚Äôt much better: study, Instagram, sit on the balcony.

Diet & exercise: I weigh 45 kg at 5‚Ä≤2‚Ä≥. I rarely feel hungry and often skip meals‚Äîor even vomit if I force myself to eat. My intake is probably 1,000‚Äì1,500 kcal/day (I'm not too sure). I barely exercise beyond occasional walks or light running.

Physical & mental health: I‚Äôve had tremors, tearfulness, and rapid thoughts. I had low energy and felt like I could faint anytime for some days. And then I fainted at school and saw a doctor who said my stress levels were dangerously high; he said I would've died if I didn't seek out help. He prescribed medication but warned me to drastically reduce stress or risk serious harm.

Coping & support: I isolate myself, do some breathing exercises, listen to music, and read to try to fall asleep. I don‚Äôt trust my family enough to open up‚Äîmy father is often absent for work but sets impossible standards and makes decisions without consulting me. I do think he's mostly the reason why I'm like this, his high expectations make me stress myself out and try to impress him, even when its just not practical and possible. My mother and sister are there, but they're okay, not necessarily a bad or a good influence. I trust my brother the most, but he's in another country and he's working, so he's really busy. He left when I was 9-11years old and that's when things started going downhill. My best friend kinda betrayed me, so I had to cut her off for my own mental peace. So now only my friend  X (he's posting this for me) knows the full story.

Barriers & hopes: My parents have the means to support therapy, but I don‚Äôt think they grasp how critical this is. I do think I've not conveyed this to them on how serious the issue really is. I want to transfer schools by moving abroad in 1‚Äì2 years, or go Uni, to finally breathe, but that feels so far away. And I can't afford to stay in this situation any longer.


I‚Äôm at my limit. I‚Äôm ""mature for my age"", shoulder most responsibilities, and yet feel utterly alone in this. I just can't fucking continue like this. I have thought of self harm but I can't do that... I'm just desperate right now. I need help.

I need advice on how to:
1. Stabilize sleep and reduce panic attacks.
2. Improve appetite and nutrition under constant stress.
3. Find affordable‚Äîand confidential‚Äîmental-health support as a minor.

1m5uwc8,depression,"college stress, dropping out, no motivation","I have been drowning under my depression for years. I've been a college student since 2020 and I hate it. I been on and off medicated for a couple years and got off of since it did nothing for me and I ended up in a mental facility. I am about 2 years from earning a degree in biology (that's if I can manage to finish before dropping out) and I hate it. I have no motivation to study, fully aware of how bad my gpa (2.16) has become and my grades are subpar, but I continue to do nothing to change it. I start to study and I begin to cry and get so overwhelmed that I have to take a break within 15 minutes. I hate doing anything that does not revolve around reading (that is my main coping mechanism) and it has become such a crutch and I cannot image doing anything else.

I have considered dropping out of college a couple of times and I have brought it up to my family but my thoughts have been dismissed, saying ""it's just stressful right now"" and ""you're so close to finishing"". For the past 3 years, I have had a breakdown about college. It is usually mid semester and wreaks my already fragile study habits for about a month.

I am so lost and annoyed and tired, I just want to read. But the idea of dropping out is terrifying, it has been so long and such a waste of money to no get that pesky diploma. All of my trauma and endurance would be for nothing if I simply call it quits. I am afraid that dropping out would make me feel extremely heavy, and I already feel so weighed down.

I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow but I needed to get some thoughts out of my head before I implode.

I know this is probably extremely common, what did yall do? Did you endure or drop out, and if you dropped out what do you do for a living (that is my main concern)?

1lwr1p9,depression,I have intense bursts of passion to a hobby then lost interest when it gets stressful,"I would call myself a ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" and I would say I'm rather frustrated at myself. Sometimes I worry I might have too many interests to balance. I have poor control in my life, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I strongly believe I have depression though I had not been diagnosed by it. And, because of that, I just feel empty all of the time. This started since I was young and now I'm 16 and still can't control anything in my life.

Because I feel empty most of the time, I just get the sudden urge to do something, anything just to appease the emptiness. Sometimes I wake up and choose drawing, sometimes music making, sometimes coding, baking, sculpting, crocheting, playing the piano, thinking about life choices (this one's great üòÉ), and most of the time, I just wake up and want to do nothing. But doing nothing just make my soul itch and makes me uncomfortable. I just need to do something. I've never been into sports mainly because I am deathly afraid to go outside my house and socialize with people so maybe that's one factor. But nevertheless, I just get INTENSE and I mean INTENSE desires to do something to relieve stress and when I encounter more stress in that hobby, I lash out and stop doing the thing (mostly happens with coding and cookingü´†). When that happens I just deflate and spiral down into destruction.

I just want to fix my shit together. Maybe I just need to go out more? I would want to but I can't find any courage to do so. Maybe it's because I constantly say I'm not good enough, if that's it I'm willing to change. It's just I'm so lost right now. Maybe it's my mental illness? But I don't like blaming it on mental illness because I can't control that. I'd rather blame it on my poor self control rather than my chaotic mind.

I actually do like math, it's just that I had a super messed up childhood and school fell into the background as a priority... I really envy kids whose parents actually cared and tried to guide them towards happiness and success. 

I was nothing more than a tool.

...

I was playing a video game a while ago, I started on the hardest difficulty and realized not long after beating the first boss that it wouldn't be fun if I didn't switch to a lower difficulty. I feel like I'm at the same place with life; I started on hellish nightmare mode, and now I don't want to play anymore unless I can switch in down to normal mode. At least in that game I was able to switch it down... I could have beaten it... but I wouldn't have been able to use the characters that I liked... it would have turned into a chore. Life shouldn't be a chore.

I'm worried about the future. It would have been nice if I had been able to just focus on what I was studying previously, but it felt like such a waste of time. 

I can't force myself to do anything that I'm not interested in. It just doesn't work. 

Either I take these math courses, which I like, but might fail, or I take something which I'm not interested in, and fail anyways.

What if I fail? I just don't have an answer for that question. 

What would I do with my life? 

If I can just make it through the next three years of school... at least I won't feel like a failure anymore, and more door will be open to me... If I don't... graduate... I will feel so lost and hopeless. I might just kill myself if it comes to that. I mean, what would the alternative be? I can't even fulfill my obvious destiny of being a sad clown because circuses don't even really exist like that anymore.

Well, I guess I just work on my math and hope that I'm ready come September.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7s7fl/im_already_stressed_about_school/,1753323117.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1m65zhr,depression,Depression as Chronic Stress: My Perspective,"**Disclaimer:**¬†*I'm not a healthcare professional; I'm just someone living with depression trying to understand it. This text may contain errors. My only goal is to share my view of depression based on my experience.*

Depression is often seen as a huge, complicated problem ‚Äî but maybe it doesn't need to be so hard to understand.

# The Real Cause Behind ‚ÄúMultifactorial‚Äù

People often say depression has many different causes or factors. For many, including me, that‚Äôs confusing: where do you even start if there are so many? But from my experience living with depression, I believe it doesn‚Äôt really have many fundamental causes. There‚Äôs one main factor:¬†**stress**. The ‚Äúmany causes‚Äù of depression actually come from the different¬†**stressors**¬†that trigger stress in each person. Stress itself, however, is universal ‚Äî we all feel it ‚Äî and it can be understood and managed.

# Stressor vs. Stress: What‚Äôs the Difference?

A¬†**stressor**¬†is what causes your stress ‚Äî and these can be many things: illness, negative thoughts, bad diet, loneliness, unhealthy habits, genetics, sensitivity to stress, and especially¬†**trauma**. Traumatic experiences ‚Äî especially early in life ‚Äî can leave deep marks that make the body stay in a constant state of alert for way too long.¬†**Stress**, on the other hand, is your body‚Äôs natural reaction to threats. It‚Äôs useful and important in its original role. The key is that while you might not always fix the stressor, you can lower your¬†**stress response**¬†with solid, consistent habits.

# Chronic Stress and Its Effects on the Brain

When stress lasts too long, it literally changes your brain physically. Studies show these changes (see:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421159/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421159/)) and the brain changes seen in depression ([https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8490908/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8490908/)). Interestingly, these changes affect the same brain areas, showing a direct link between chronic stress and depression.

# From Stress to Depression: The Breakdown Process

Stress wears you down ‚Äî mentally and physically. But depression feels like what happens when that wear and tear becomes chronic, like your system has been running on empty for too long. Both stress and depression involve similar damage: fatigue, negative thinking, poor sleep, low motivation. But depression feels like the next level ‚Äî like your mind has stopped trying to recover and has shifted into survival mode.

In that sense, depression could be seen as chronic stress taken too far. It's not just a response to a threat anymore ‚Äî it's the aftermath of prolonged overload.

# Self-Destructive Thoughts: A Twisted Survival Mechanism

Self-destructive thoughts don‚Äôt happen for no reason. Our body hates stress because it drains energy and resources. Long ago, when we faced real external threats (like predators), stress responses made sense ‚Äî a quick, harsh reaction to survive.

But what if the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù is inside? When stress comes from fearful or unrealistic thoughts about your own reality? Your brain‚Äôs response might be self-destruction. It might sound strange, but your brain treats internal threats like external ones because it can‚Äôt tell the difference.

# Care and Treatment: Tackling the Root

Taking medication alone isn‚Äôt enough if you‚Äôre sensitive to stress. That‚Äôs why having a balanced routine is essential:

* **For Stress (universal management):**
   * **Regular exercise:**¬†helps regulate your nervous system and release tension.
   * **Nutritious diet:**¬†avoid sugar, unhealthy fats, and processed foods that increase inflammation and biological stress.
   * **Stay hydrated:**¬†drink plenty of water.
   * **Sunlight exposure:**¬†helps regulate your body clock and mood.
   * **Sleep hygiene:**¬†get good, restful sleep to recover body and mind.
   * **Social interaction:**¬†getting out and connecting with people is vital.

These steps help reduce how sensitive you are to stress by working directly on your body.

* **For Stressors (individual management):**¬†This depends on your personal problems: physical illnesses, negative thinking patterns, unhealthy lifestyle, toxic relationships, and more. Therapy can help with many stressors. Some problems need medical help. Whatever the case, always seek professional physical and mental healthcare.

# Conclusion: Depression as Advanced Chronic Stress

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything ‚Äúnew‚Äù here, just connections I‚Äôve made that might help others like me who suffer. Depression isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù in the usual sense, but it can deeply damage you.

At some point I finally realized none of it did shit. The moment it got quiet, how I truly felt would show up; deep sadness for no reason. It was all self-gaslighting and repressing. It took so many years but I finally realize I'm not creating the depression, it's not my fault, and it's so relieving to realize I'm not the one doing it.

I realized even the negative thoughts is a symptom of depression and you can't think different your way out of depression.

I'm now working on trauma healing. That's another possibility I will exhaust and I had some of the least depressed days of my life. Its like I could taste the weather. My self-blame or internal shame for no reason is gone. If a hurtful thing happens I'll quickly be back to being emotionally regulated again. Sad for no reason and emptiness? it is also lower.

1dkq73r,depression,Dad has depression and developing dementia,"Hi everyone.

My dad was diagnosed with bi-polar ll (depressive only) at 40 years old. He‚Äôs now 70 and recently retired, going through another depressive episode with dementia is the newest symptom.

He‚Äôs on new medication and everything to combat this. But what‚Äôs been hard for him is not knowing what to do all day. He is obviously too depressed to do things that are enjoyable, and now that he doesn‚Äôt have to work he has no idea what to to do. Before he worked non-stop to support a family of four as immigrants. I feel that his loss of purpose might be making it harder to get better/see the point in life.

He is also very guilty of how this is affecting my mom. On the phone I told him, I wish for him to be happy. And he said he wishes for my mom to be happy. And I told him he deserves it just as much as she does, and I told him to not think about that too much, as it probably isn‚Äôt helpful for his own self esteem.

Does anyone who has depression have any thoughts or experience with being depressed and feeling idle? How did you get through those grueling boring days? My mom won‚Äôt let him go on walks sometimes when she thinks it‚Äôs unsafe. I am beside myself and hurting for my dad. He‚Äôs an amazing person, I just think working all his life has made him lose his identity.

I have failed to integrate into the community and powerful people at work don‚Äôt like me. ,"Started a new career since I finished up grad school just in time for my dad to get Covid and die.  Found out after his death that my mom had dementia and he had been caring for her and keeping it a secret for years.  This was unexpected given her relatively young age.  

I took for my first job in my new career an easy going job in a small town 2 hours away from my previous location.  Shortly after starting the gig there were several changes in my career field which required rapid changes to my role.  Often I was left basically paid to relax in the office.  My role has slowly expanded but in the rural setting my increasing utilization has been unsteady and I‚Äôve had no real extra training or adjustment process beyond my coworkers who have been accommodating most times.  It‚Äôs still strange to basically be in charge of your own training.  

Found out today some work I was involved in didn‚Äôt meet the standard and I will be receiving a written reprimand.  Basically, a prompt to improve, but at the same time creating a paper trail for my dismissal if I don‚Äôt.  

I‚Äôve heard basically from reliable sources I‚Äôm basically disliked by pretty much everyone in power who doesn‚Äôt work directly with me.  

In a small town tight knit community I can‚Äôt really see myself continuing at this job in such a situation. 

I just hate that it‚Äôs come to this and I have failed to integrate.

He leads a completely normal life and even continues working; however, he is unable to remember certain events that happened a specific period of time ago.  
His short-term memory is completely normal‚Äîhe can remember recent events and those that occurred up to 1 or 2 months ago. However, if you ask him about something prior to that time frame, he is unable to recall it, as if he had never experienced it.  
Additionally, his memory is also normal regarding events he lived through from childhood up until approximately 10 years ago.  

For the past 2 or 3 years, he has had Meni√®re‚Äôs syndrome, but aside from that, he has no health issues or any other diagnosed condition.  

In terms of his personality, he has always been an extremely quiet and uncommunicative person. Lately, he has been saying that he feels quite nervous and depressed.  

His father had Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  

He has visited a neurologist without success. A brain MRI showed completely normal results, and short-term memory tests also came back normal.  

I have searched the internet for information, but I have not been able to find any website or article discussing symptoms like the ones my father is experiencing.

So I thought nothing of it when I started having it. But it kept getting more severe where I was getting blood in my stools so I quit. Kept happening for a month before I went to the hospital. I ended up with a $1000 visit. Then they had me get a colonoscopy which was another $2000. I don't have any money so I am applying for medicaid naturally.

When I do sleep, it's usually in a car or on a friend's couch or floor when I'm hanging out with them. I have a bit of a list of different things going on.

Heartbeat races, I mean RACES, before I fall asleep throwing me into some sort of paranoid lucid dream where I can't move, feels like my entire body is violently shaking, almost a seizure. I cannot tell what's real and what isn't as I'm in my bed the entire time. Not sure if this is a panic attack, seizure, anxiety attack, it's seriously bothering me.

I pass out 2-5 times a week just from standing up. I had an EKG (If that's the test of blood pressure or heart rate between laying, sitting, and standing), and an echocardiogram. The EKG showed a big difference between sitting and standing that was abnormal.

I have quite an extreme metabolism, I've eaten an upwards of 12k calories in a single day, doing nothing but laying around, and I stay at a steady 135lbs. I do not exercise or play sports.

Mostly when I'm trying to sleep, my mind doesn't stop thinking, my blood pressure doesn't slow down as if I'm going to sleep, it feels like I'm trying to concentrate on a variety of things instead of sleep.

So recently I've been having what feel like panic attacks, but I'm very happy with my life. I love my SO, I love what I study, I have a great cat and amazing friends.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD (I had a traumatic childhood) but I've never -felt- like I had it. By that I mean, I didn't really consciously feel stressed or upset about it, I just sort of, ignore that it even happened. I have also had stress related eating disorders where I couldn't eat, even though I felt like eating, and didn't feel troubled, apparently I had subconscious stress and was working on getting myself a stomach ulcer.  

It's all really annoying because these panic attacks like, take over me. They make me want to cry, I get short of breath and just feel really pancky, the complete opposite of who I am. I don't want to go to counselling because I've spent years in it and I really don't feel like there's anything wrong with me mentally, just my body is saying differently.

ojyh2,health,Was that a panic attack? Or a mild heart attack?,"I am a 23 year old, first semester PhD student in a technical field.

I have a history of mental illness, specifically depression and anxiety... I was diagnosed as an Aspie in elementary school, but I feel that was a misdiagnosis.

I have gone from being in an approved-private school to a PhD program. I recently accepted a very prestigious internship.

I've still got a lot of stress. While I network and make friends fine, I haven't had much luck with women. I lost over 50lbs, but I still obsess over my weight/looks...

Which leads me to today. I felt kind of crappy all day. I took it as a sign I shouldn't drink so much... I went out drinking Friday and Saturday, and had a lot both nights (8+ drinks). I drank a lot of water, so I didn't have a hangover, but I noticed my mood was off. I made a mental note to watch my consumption in the future. I also had a slight ache in my chest, but it felt like a sprained muscle... it's hard to descibe.

Anyways, I went to the gym and was doing bent over rows, and suddenly, it was like there was a rock in my chest, riight in the middle. If you drew a line between my nipples, right in the center... and this rock was throbbing, and the pain spread to my back. 

I sat down, and started to feel scared. I know someone who had a heart defect and just flat out died playing basketball. And while I sometimes feel anxious, I have only had a panic attack once. (And I'm not sure if that was one or a heart issue as well)

Anyways, I am not sure what happened. On one hand, I was not stressed out... I have a few small things to do this evening, but otherwise it was a leisurely day of reading journal articles and writing some simple code.

The pain is still here, but slight. If I move, it gets worse, but not terribly so. I'm pretty convinced it's stress related, but I thought I'd try asking the internet to be safe.

I am a little stressed now... I had a couple small things to do to day, but tomorrow I am very busy so I need to do these small things (like read a book chapter) tonight, or I won't have time...

Anyways, what are reddit's thoughts? I can go into more detail if needed...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/ojyh2/was_that_a_panic_attack_or_a_mild_heart_attack/,1326755404.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1p4ft1,health,Panic / Anxiety attack?,"I should preface this with the fact that I had an endoscopy done almost 2 weeks ago and was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis.  I had been experiencing chest pains but was checked by an immediate care clinic and everything looked fine (blood tests ekg).  This was done the previous weekend...

So last night was pretty horrible for me.  Was going out to dinner with a friend, he was driving. I notice while we were driving that I was very short of breath while talking and could barely finish a sentence.  We stop some where and I started feeling incredibly faint and un focused.  My heart was beating out of my chest and I could barely breath.  I checked my heart rate on my phone and it was 150bpm.  

I ask my friend if he could take me to the ER instead politely which he is confused at first but realizes that I'm serious as I can't quite focus my eyes on anything.  I maintain consciousness through the ride though I feel at any moment I could pass out.  I feel like I was burning up so I opened a window.  My heart rate is now around 156-159.

Get to the hospital, I tell them I have chest pain and feel like I'm about to pass about, and can't breathe they take me calmly to triage.  Take my vitals and I don't remember what my blood pressure was but my pulse had gone down to 119 but I still felt completely unfocused and faint.  

I had a few weeks ago got an endoscopy and was on prevacid so I told them this information, they took me to get an x-ray.  Took some blood work and put in an IV and monitor my vitals.  

After about an hour or two my heart rate comes back down to 96-99.  Results come back from the tests and everything looks good.  The Dr. was really nice but he seemed to kind of think it was anxiety from the beginning.  I feel kind of stupid because I felt like I was going to die.  

Today I'm walking around with some portable EKG as they want to monitor my heart for a day to see anything unusual.  


TLDR:  Apparently had some random anxiety attack where I felt like passing out and my heart rate was almost up to 160.   Ended up being just an anxiety attack but thought I was dying.  Walking around with a portable EKG so they can look at results from my heart all day.

1mk2l7,health,Having a major panic attack. Where can I get a free and quick STD test tomorrow with no appointment without having to tell my parents?,"I'm in Long Island, New York. I found this[1] , but I am assuming they will turn me away if I don't have all the legal paperwork that my parents have stashed somewhere.
It is also only Free HIV Testing, and all the other tests I have to pay for. I guess that's better than nothing? Gonnorhea, Syphilis, and Chlamydia are all curable, so I guess I don't really care as much if that stuff sprouts up in a month, no need to blow my entire life savings just to get a 1 month headstart.

From the Planned Parenthood website:
*Payment is expected at time of service unless other arrangements have been previously made.
Some HIV services may be covered by your insurance. If you want to use your insurance, please be sure to bring in your insurance information at the time of your visit.
Medicaid accepted.
If you are uninsured, you may qualify for a state-funded program or a lower fee scale.*
So as a 19 year old without Medicaid or copies of my insurance paperwork or my own source of income obviously all of this stuff is a barrier for me, am I out of luck? I don't even have access to my own Social Security card, it's in a firesafe lockbox somewhere in my house. There's clearly no way I'm getting this done, I'm considering just crossing my fingers for a few months and hoping I get no symptoms of anything.

11cqpj0,ChronicIllness,High calprotectin. Not IBD.,"I was diagnosed with IBD in June 2022 based on inflammation with a calprotectin of 1000. Biopsies of colonoscopy and endoscopy did not confirm IBD, GI found it odd. Nuclear, speckled 1:40 ANA (barely positive).

My calprotectin did drop to normal ranges after a month on Prednisone but symptoms were still present. Since then, I have failed Humira and was put back on Prednisone. Symptoms still present.

A more recent colonoscopy showed mast cells and the biopsies still couldn't confirm IBD. My GI revoked my diagnosis of IBD and told me to follow up with an immunologist, which I have an appt for in April.

I was taken off Prednisone and Claritin. I was put on Xyzal, and Pepcid. I'm continuing to take Pantoprazole. Symptoms are currently worsening.

The one thing that is bothering me is that I had a very high calprotectin result which I can't find a reason for other than IBD or an infection. Infection tests were clean.

I'm also diagnosed with autism and hEDS. Suspected POTS and MCAS.

Main symptoms include joint pain (consistent but worsens along GI issues), bloating, gas, belching, GERD-like symptoms, constipation, whole abdomen pain. Since being taken off Prednisone, I've had increased gas, belching, nausea, semi-loss of appetite, and sightly bloody diarrhea.

What else besides IBD and infections can result in such a high calprotectin? Anything else I should ask to be looked into?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/11cqpj0/high_calprotectin_not_ibd/,1677440934.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

If it were, it would get better with activity, not worse.‚Äù He still ordered some further tests so I guess it could have been worse but it was just frustrating. 

I had been waiting for this appointment on their wait list for months trying to get in and get answers but now I just feel stupid. Every symptom I explained seemed to hardly matter to him, he‚Äôd just say ‚Äúokay.‚Äù No further questions or comments. And idk maybe he was just trying to stay neutral since we have no results yet from the labs but it just felt like he didn‚Äôt care honestly. 

I‚Äôm more discouraged than ever trying to figure out my health even though technically I am getting testing and all. Just hard to deal with a medical professional who looks at you like you‚Äôre stupid when you‚Äôre there because you‚Äôve been miserable since you were 12.

1llo4tn,ChronicIllness,Finally about to be diagnosed and treated after years of being told it‚Äôs anxiety,"Hello all
I‚Äôm new to this subreddit as I just realized it exists so hello!

I‚Äôve suffered for 8 years with debilitating productive cough, fatigue, pain, and seemingly random inexplicable medical issues. I‚Äôve been a victim of diagnostic overshadowing despite renal issues, cardiac issues and visible signs of disease. Everything is ‚Äúfibromyalgia‚Äù or ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen over 30 docs and have been fully open minded with investigations and empirical treatments to which none worked.
I‚Äôve actually developed anxiety/depression because of the impact of my poor health on my life. Not the other way around.

Having finally found a doctor who did his own investigations and was thorough I‚Äôve finally got imaging, cytology and structural evidence of chronic disease that has remodelled my lungs and having ruled all the common causes out it leaves one thing on the table, the thing I‚Äôve been saying I think it is the whole time.

In two weeks I will have my appointment where I hopefully will get the official diagnosis and potential treatment as well as a correction in my file and I can‚Äôt tell you how it feels.
It‚Äôs surreal like I‚Äôm scared if I step on a spider or something my diagnoses will slip away.

Invisible illness has left me unable to continue my job for the past 6 months and I‚Äôve been on a leave. Today I received a phone call saying they hired someone new and to come get my stuff- so it‚Äôs been a massive element in my life.

Documentation is coming and treatment.
Sadly I know I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù healthy again since it took 8 years to be taken seriously and it‚Äôs caused irreversible damage now but maybe I can have a functional life again.

They did an EKG and chest X-ray which both came back normal and the doctor then told me that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with my lungs and I just need to ‚Äúmanage my anxiety around being sick‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt anxious about being sick. I‚Äôm sick all the time, it doesn‚Äôt scare me.

i (24) got covid first time in april 2023 
then again this year beginning of january was vax and always mask but alas it happened.

since February i have been charting symptoms that at first didnt think were related until about a few weeks ago. i had noticed that i frequently need to go pee and then also urinary retention. Im always bloated no matter how much i watch what i eat and my bowel movements fluctuate like crazy. i also noticed in March (winter in Ontario, Canada) i always needed the AC blasting while washing the dishes, vacuuming, doing any chores and was getting so out of breath and heart palpitations (i do these chores every single day cuz i have 3 cats). i can‚Äôt handle a little bit of heat i either get a bunch of symptoms with no sweating or sweat when i shouldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶

I can‚Äôt stay standing for long without getting extremely nauseous or lightheaded.

it has gotten to a point where this june i had to wake up at dawn to go biking or else i‚Äôd die from the heat. and then i couldn‚Äôt bike at all because i felt like i was dying. 

i‚Äôm more active than ive been in years and yet i can‚Äôt catch my breath up the stairs of my house. i sit down any chance i get because my heart is at 140bpm. 

i decided enough is enough i can‚Äôt function like this any longer and decided to go to a walk in near me since my family doctor always dismisses me. i felt extremely heard at the walk in and he referred me for pulmonary and cardiac testing (x-ray, EKG, ECG, stress test, 48hr holter monitor) to make sure to rule out any other issues.

while waiting for my results and my cardiologist appointment (that was today), i had been trying to see if there‚Äôs anyone else experiencing these symptoms and the closest i could get was dysautonomia. 

today i go to see the cardiologist. my appointment was at 2pm, i saw the nurse practitioner around 3:30, that‚Äôs okay i understand it‚Äôs busy. i tell her why i was referred and she just goes ‚Äúoh your tests all came back normal.‚Äù 

so i was like ‚Äúim glad its not a primary cardiac issue but it does seem like SOMETHING is causing these cardiac-like symptoms.‚Äù 

she says ‚Äúhave you checked hormones?‚Äù i said yes. she asked me if i have any stressors in my life, i said ‚Äúno‚Äù (besides literally these symptoms i have no stressors!!) 

‚Äúdo u drink water?‚Äù yes i do. 

‚Äúhave you tried getting up and switching positions slowly?‚Äù ofc i have. 

she says ‚Äúwell we will send ur family doctor the results just be happy it‚Äôs not a heart issue.‚Äù

i was like that‚Äôs it?? thankfully the cardiologist came in and i was hoping to hear ‚Äúwe can run some autonomic tests‚Äù after i repeatedly explained how i don‚Äôt have any regulation in my nervous system. NOPE. 

he looked at the test results in front of me and turned to the np and said ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre all normal why are we having this appointment‚Äù

so now im back at the beginning. no answers. but i should be happy right? happy that i have to schedule an appointment with my general practitioner to give another referral to an electrophysiologist or neurologist that will take months to see just so i know what may be wrong with me :)) IF THERES EVEN ANY ACCEPTING REFERRALS",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1m6ryb1/just_got_told_it_must_be_stress_or_hormones_since/,1753222652.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1ltb1bf,ChronicIllness,Stressed and scared.,"So I had a hell of a journey getting diagnosed with my autoimmune conditions. Took years of begging and pleading with doctors to try and find answers. Got sick at 19/20yo. 26 now. I was almost in remission. Feeling so much better. Joints moving good, energy levels higher consistently, working harder. 

And then‚Ä¶ BOOM. Lymph nodes swell. I‚Äôm not fussed cause nothing really gets me worked up anymore. Figured it‚Äôd go away. Then it didn‚Äôt. It got worse. 

Over 7 weeks my lymph nodes on my neck have swollen and gotten hard. More nearby lymph nodes doing the same. And I feel like shit. My exhaustion is at a new level I have never seen, went from walking 8-12kms a day, to not even being capable of one. This week I‚Äôve been home from work mostly in bed. Feeling worse every day. 

It‚Äôs defeating. It‚Äôs defeating seeing doctors and them being like yeah maybe we need to take a look and see but let‚Äôs wait for now. 

Heading into week 8 of swelling and exhaustion. Seeing doctor again Tuesday to try and maybe get some answers. Blood work came back fine (as usual). Can‚Äôt swallow well, can‚Äôt breathe if I lay on that side. My voice is hoarser than an 80 year old smoker. 

I‚Äôve been building my business steadily for a few years, working really hard. And now, once again, it‚Äôs all ripped out from under me. 

Regardless of what I do, how much I rest, how well I take care of myself, I feel like the girl I was when I first got sick. Confused, scared, feeling super sick all the time. 

Once again, begging and pleading for doctors to take me seriously, and to get the help I need. Stressed beyond belief because being sick doesn‚Äôt pay the bills. I don‚Äôt want to have my care repoed again. I don‚Äôt want to be homeless again.

The holiday season can be incredibly stressful for people that aren‚Äôt chronically ill and/or disabled. Expectations put on us are high, with demands on our time, money and affections. 

For those of us that are chronically ill, the holiday season can go from stressful to seemingly insurmountable, and in many cases can even make us sicker. In addition to the aforementioned issues, traveling can be extremely difficult if not entirely impossible, eating big family meals can be triggering symptom wise and emotionally/mentally, and of course, the drain on energy induced by socializing, traveling, shopping, sleeping away from home, eating and more can result in flareups and further issues. Lastly, we all have those family members that don‚Äôt keep up with our daily lives but always have ‚Äúadvice‚Äù about our pain, diets, treatments and more. Ugh. 

Discuss it here! How do you feel about the upcoming holidays? What are your plans? What are your fears? What are you dreading? How many ‚Äújust drink water‚Äù or ‚Äúdo some yoga‚Äù or ‚Äúhave you tried essential oils?‚Äù remarks would it take for you to call it all off and stay home from November to February? 

Please be supportive of each other while also remembering and respecting that this sub is open to CI members internationally, and not everyone celebrates the same holidays, nor does everyone enjoy them. All sub rules apply to pinned discussions. I hope this fosters a sense of community and belonging!

1lagl6j,ChronicIllness,"Urgent Advice!!! Neurogenic Pruritus / Urticaria, Heat + Stress. How to survive in heat?!","
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm in a really difficult situation and could use input from anyone with experience in heat-induced pruritus, urticaria, or neurogenic itch.

My condition:

I suffer from severe itching triggered specifically by heat, temperature changes, and emotional stress. I‚Äôve been dealing with this chronically for years, but it‚Äôs gotten progressively worse. Currently I‚Äôm under specialist care at a university hospital ( Dermatology Erasmus MC, NL) for atypical pruritus that seems to involve features of both neurogenic itch and urticaria.
	‚Ä¢	No visible rash most of the time.
	‚Ä¢	But the itch feels internal, like my nervous system is overfiring.
	‚Ä¢	It gets dramatically worse with sudden warmth, heatwaves, stress, or even walking outside.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm now over 1 month on Cyclosporine 300mg/day and it helps partially at rest, but fails completely during external triggers.
	‚Ä¢	Antihistamines (desloratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, rupatadine) were ineffective.

The urgent problem:

Next weekend I‚Äôm supposed to attend a major outdoor event. Temperatures are forecasted to hit 33¬∞C+ (91¬∞F), and I‚Äôll be outside in a dense, crowded, stimulating environment all day Saturday and Sunday.

This is the exact type of situation that causes severe flare-ups:
	‚Ä¢	Body starts overheating,
	‚Ä¢	Stress kicks in,
	‚Ä¢	Adrenaline surges,
	‚Ä¢	Full-body burning itch follows,
	‚Ä¢	I often have to stop everything and go into emergency cooling mode.

I have a urgent specialist appointment next Wednesday, at the university hospital but that‚Äôs too late for my doing I think. On Monday I will speak with my GP to ask for temporary, safe pharmacological support.

What I‚Äôm looking for and was thinking of: 
	‚Ä¢	Medication options that help regulate physical stress and/or heat response, even just for a few days.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve heard propranolol could reduce heart rate, adrenaline spikes, and thermoregulatory reactivity but not so sure.
	‚Ä¢	I cannot take anything serotonergic (SSRIs, mirtazapine, etc.) I had a horrible reaction in the past (pruritus worsened for some reason).
	‚Ä¢	Cooling strategies are already in place (ice packs, loose clothing, hydration), but not enough for full day exposure.
	‚Ä¢	I just need something to bridge this weekend safely without triggering a full-body crisis.


My questions:

- Has anyone had success with beta-blockers, or anything else that calms the body‚Äôs internal storm (temp, adrenaline, nerves)?
- Any experiences with these not worsening urticaria or neurogenic itch?
- What should I ask my doctor for? What should I avoid?

Perhaps you will think ‚Äúwhy book all of this if you were unstable with your health?‚Äù But the thing is I booked these tickets months ago when it was bearable to walk outside no matter the situation and couldn‚Äôt know I would be in this terrible position that I am in today. Tickets are non refundable no matter what and everything has been settled.


Thanks so much to anyone reading. I‚Äôm honestly panicking and trying to avoid canceling something that means a lot to me ‚Äî but also terrified of ending up in a serious flare abroad. 

Thank you again,

1ju6smm,ChronicIllness,Bad brain fog after a year of pain and intense stress. Is this normal?,"Hello! For the past year I have been in hell. Constant pain and extreme stress and panic caused by it. My endometriosis was unbearable and I was waiting on surgery, I developed sciatica, and my stomach was destroyed from all the NSAIDs I was taking for my endo. I couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt walk or sit much, always had cramping, and was in and out of the ER and doctors for a good half of the year. I finally got my endo surgery (so much was removed, including my appendix!!), my stomach is healing and is a lot better now, and the removal of endo from the base of my spine has helped my sciatic pain. All the inflammation now being gone has brought down my anxiety and panic as well, but now my mind is so spotty and awful. I feel like I have constant brain fog, I forget countless things almost immediately. I used to view myself as smart but I just feel so dumb now, I can‚Äôt retain information well and I just feel stupid and not with it anymore. Is this normal after going through so much? And if so will it go away? I‚Äôm going back to college and I‚Äôm scared this will impact my classes.

1hviqns,ChronicIllness,Financial stress of living with chronic illness :(,"I live in Australia, so I know in terms of medical costs it could be so much worse (really feel for you in the US in terms of costs). But the financial stress of living with Chronic Fatigue, Long Covid and POTS, IBS, reactive hypoglycaemia, and undiagnosed hypermobility (not to mention mental health concerns and ADHD), is really, really weighing on me, and has been for a long time now.

My fluctuating, sometimes debilitating, and mostly invisible symptoms make holding down a job SO hard. Thank god my boss and team leader are so empathetic and kind (actual legends who genuinely endeavour to understand), but my workplace has to cut the staffing budget and casuals will be first to go - so the flexibility I've been afforded may not be possible anymore, and I might lose my hours if I can't be consistent (which I can't). As it was, this year I've only been able to work on average 1.5 to 2 days per week which is just scraping through, and we've been on holiday break since before Christmas so I'm really struggling to make rent.

So I barely have any income - I've just applied for centrelink jobseeker so fingers crossed ü§û but it's not really enough to cover costs on its own. I'm told I'm not eligible for disability.

As many of you understand, I also have higher, less flexible costs than the average person - $240/month bare minimum for medications I need to function, and ideally I need more supplements than that price accounts for. Then there's GP appointments (mine doesn't bulk-bill, but she's amazing so don't wanna switch), 

My diet has been very limited since developing gut issues, I already can't eat gluten (legitimate intolerance as severe as coeliac, likely genetic), but for the last 1.5yrs I've had IBS which has taken away my broke staple, beans. I also have reactive hypoglycaemia/postprandial dumping which means I have to eat a strict low-GI diet, but that + my IBS diet + GF leaves me with limited budget-friendly options. I do alright, I'm learning, and starting to enjoy food again but, for example, a lot of my friends shop only at discount supermarkets or bin-dive alot (really not as gross as you'd think haha), and save hundreds doing so, but I rely on supermarkets because I have such specific requirements. When I get my diet right, I function a lot better than when I don't- my long covid really flares up when my IBS or blood sugar go wacky.

Then, sometimes my health had been so bad that I haven't been able to cook for myself. I haven't often had someone to support me with meals because the diet is confusing to others, so I've ended up ordering delivery, and have racked up a bunch of afterpay debt - I'm vowing off it now, but this is still hanging over me. Stupid I know, but I felt like I had no choice.

My bills could also be lower... I run my fan almost constantly now it's summer because on the hot days my POTS gets so bad I can lose the ability to stay upright.

All the little things other low-income folks do to save money are inaccessible to me - I don't have the capacity to walk or ride to work/shops, or the option to live on rice and beans, or save power by turning off the fan.

Now rent is approaching in a couple weeks and I just don't know where the money is going to come from. I had to take today off work due to a flare up and who knows about tomorrow. I've looked through so many disability and crisis help services and I don't seem to be eligible for any - chronic illness has too much of a 'fluctuating' nature, or I'm not enough at risk of homelessness, or I'm not young enough or old enough, or I still technically have a job so it doesn't count. It's just so stressful and I know I'm privileged in many ways, but god I just feel like I'm slipping through the cracks here. How do you manage?

1j5yljv,ChronicIllness,"""If you're not exercising, it's like you're actively taking depressants""","This is a phrase I've heard an HR person at my work repeat multiple times - like a mantra - in events aimed at talking about the importance of mental health. She'll follow it up with ""and I mean, even just taking a walk, guys,"" and talk about how her mental health improved tremendously when she started to take walks. She brings up endorphins and how wonderful they are, and she'll even throw in that it's not about losing weight!


It still...bugs me. I know that, obviously, exercise is a proven aid to mental health. And for a lot of people, it's a cornerstone. I'm not disputing that. And most advice is going to be for the able-bodied, that's the world we live in. Still, the phrasing feels weirdly accusatory to me. 


I guess I'm wondering if I'm reading too much into it?  I feel the urge to roll my eyes each time I hear her say it.

1jd1mfg,ChronicIllness,I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a chronic illness but my doctor keeps blaming it on depression,"I have been struggling with intense exhaustion and sleep issues for almost two years now. Every single waking moment I am unbelievably sleepy. If I am able to I will sleep for 15+ hours a day. I sleep throughout the entire night, sleep through half my classes, and then take naps as soon as I get home. No matter how much I sleep the exhaustion never goes away. 

About a year ago I finally got into a sleep specialist. I had a sleep study and MLST done where sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy and basically every other sleep disorder we‚Äôre ruled out. My sleep study showed that I basically repeatedly wake up in the night unconsciously and get very little deep sleep. My MLST showed a low sleep latency, I remained asleep for all 15 minutes, and I did not enter REM sleep once.

Despite all this, in my follow up appointment my doctor just explained to me that depression can cause insomnia. I know that. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression for six years. I know what depression tiredness is like cause I‚Äôve experienced it and this is not it. In fact my depression has significantly worsened DUE to the sleep issues. I have not received any diagnoses based on my sleep results.

The very first thing the doctor tried to do in terms of medicine was change my anti-depressant.

Eventually he instead prescribed me clonidine. After several months of the clonidine doing absolutely nothing to help the doctor has finally messaged me about how it‚Äôs been working. I explained it hasn‚Äôt whatsoever. His response was to try changing my anti-depressant, Zoloft, to trazodone or remeron. 

I really don‚Äôt think doing any of that will help because the exhaustion has not been caused by my depression. I‚Äôm at the end of my rope with this and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have an appointment with my pediatrician in April to hopefully get a second opinion but I have no idea if she can actually help. 

It‚Äôs been two years of constant exhaustion. Every day is a living hell and I‚Äôm never able to enjoy anything because of it. I fear that since I‚Äôm mentally ill, I‚Äôll never be taken seriously and just be forced to suffer with this forever.

1m1qpw0,ChronicIllness,Stolen childhood. Or maybe just my depression.,"Hello. In september, i turned 18. That day i recieved a call that im finally getting a kidney after almost 3 years of dialysis.
*****
Ive been fighting ANCA for nearly 8 years. Before that, i was bullied both by family and by school mates. 

I know there are people that have it even worse than me. And i know that i should just shut up and bear the pain like my mother did with everything. But i just cant. In that 8 years i was basically locked out from even a semi-normal life. While others could grow up and be around people their age, i was mostly at home or in the hospital for treatment. 

I dont know why, but i feel like i never really had a childhood. I say i dont know why because im not sure if this is normal, okay, valid, whatever else...

Am i supposed to feel this way?

I dont know, but it sure as hell hurts. 
I spent nearly half my birthdays in pain and guilt because i caused the damage that lead to the need for trasplant. I forget everything. I always did. And it always was recieved as me being rude, a bad child or just straight up an idiot. And at that point, i hated myself for it.

And now that i got the ""you can go and live"", i want to experience what i lost. But how when all my friends are doing their own stuff now? How when i dont fit into that scene anymore? How when i know i should be studying and working instead?

But as soon as the pain relinquishs, at least a bit, my mood is so good. I literally feel motivated and happy and hopeful. Like when the pain subsides I'm so happy and productive- like using that time to learn a new language or smth fun.

It‚Äôs a bitch to deal with on its own, but I at least know what to do, how to keep going, things that I can hold on to.

Dealing with these health issues for almost a year now with no real answers, I‚Äôve been trying so hard to like, keep my head on, keep doing what I can, try to find moments of joy, talk to friends, etc. I had convinced myself that physically I was a wreck but mentally I was doing okay, all things considered. 

I don‚Äôt know if I was kidding myself or it‚Äôs all just catching up to me but I do know one thing: I‚Äôm definitely not okay. I don‚Äôt have the energy to pick a hobby or an outdoor activity or do a workout or go out with friends. I barely can get out of bed.

I feel like I‚Äôve isolated myself to where I just don‚Äôt have enough people in a support system now either, or I reach out and they‚Äôre just not there so then I kind of give up.

My PCP gave me the scopolamine patches which completely stopped the dizziness.

1fl1hsv,ChronicIllness,Major side effects... help please!,"Ok, I know I'm on a crap load of medications but I'm having some major side effects. They are truly affecting what little of a ""life"" I have left at this point. I need suggestions, experiences, anything and everything you might think would help.

I'm having major fatigue, to the point that I just randomly fall asleep and then I can't seem to wake back up. It's awful! I have a 7 year old daughter that means the world to me and she needs me to be at least awake for her. But recently I just can't do it. I've tried caffeine pills, coffee, energy drinks at this point. I've tried to talk to my doctors. They keep passing the buck to eachother (I have quite a few). Now everyone is saying it's my cpap, but from my experience that doesn't matter. How long I wear it or how often, I always feel the same. They keep changing my levels on my cpap and that just sucks since it can make it pretty different depending on what they do.

The second major side effect is some crazy brain fog. I've talked to my neurologist and she just says it's my medicine and to talk to my other doctors. I've done a test to make sure it's not something like alzheimers, it's not. I just don't know what to do. I have trouble focusing and thinking. It's like it goes in one ear and never even makes it to the other before, poof it's gone... 

Thanks for reading through this and if you can help at all I greatly appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1fl1hsv/major_side_effects_help_please/,1726798562.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
1e1bv49,ChronicIllness,Do any of you have family who are available for everyone except you?,"TW: CSA mentioned. Not graphic

Demographics: Me (50f), sister (54f), Mom (80f), and Dad (81m) are the main players. I got my first chronic diagnosis (scoliosis) followed closely by migraine with auras at 15. Since then it‚Äôs been something autoimmune/chronic every 5-10 years in addition to seasonal/viruses like Epstein Barr, Covid, etc. The progression went: Hashimoto‚Äôs hypothyroidism & adrenal fatigue; [1]; Enodmetriosis (with total hysterectomy; Sjogren‚Äôs & Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder (and suspected hEDS, but nothing in the chart at the time); [2]; Lupus, specific immune deficiency, and official hEDS. 

[1 & 2 were serious mental illness interruptions where physical health took a back seat. I have childhood PTSD from CSA as well as violence in the home. These were later exacerbated by a SA by a domestic partner in college, as well as a completely worldview shaking experience where the total shock of the experience led me to question everything I‚Äôd every thought I believed about the people I knew and the country I lived in. In-patient trauma psychiatric care was required.]

My parents and sister are all in service professions: teachers, ministers, etc. I was a teacher and a musician (and for that matter a minister for a time until the beliefs I was raised with were obliterated by experience). 

I have spent 20+ years in trauma recovery therapy because of CSA and other childhood abuses that affected me more than my ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù family because it was a step-grandfather that started it when I was a toddler and traded me among his friends. We have had discussions about why I have different experiences than my elder sister. And most things add up, but some things for her seem more like self-preservation and not wanting to mess with the status quo of her mind than actually dealing with the truth. The fact that she also has a bucket full of autoimmune disorders and maladaptive coping skills are big red flags, but for me, this next thing is actually the most frustrating for me:

My sister doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to deal with real life shit. Our mom has Alzheimer‚Äôs. During covid we realized we needed to be closer to my sister to have more help, so we uprooted my parents, and I moved in with them to a whole new city where we‚Äôd be close to her on the promise of more involvement from her. 

She realized that facing my disability, Mom‚Äôs dementia, and Dad getting older would be uncomfortable for her so instead of, you know, processing that, she avoids us. So much so that she decided it‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs will‚Äù for her to enter seminary at 54 so she can serve ‚Äúthe least of these.‚Äù Bitch, the least of these are your fucking family, and we‚Äôre right down the road.

My illnesses went into over drive right before Christmas. We finally figured out what was going on and I‚Äôm now on a really aggressive treatment plan - chemo, infusions, the lot. It‚Äôs kicking my ass. The days I‚Äôm not nauseated to the point where I can‚Äôt eat, I‚Äôm probably sleeping through the meals because I‚Äôm exhausted. 

But here‚Äôs the thing. When we ask for help, we get ‚Äúbusy with school, busy with family, busy with work, need time off to rest (she also has lupus, Hashimoto‚Äôs, etc).‚Äù I can‚Äôt argue with that. But then I find out things like she specifically plans lunches with girlfriends, or like tonight actually drove 2 hours to go spend the night with an old friend that moved away. What the fuck? I‚Äôm literally fighting for my life. I haven‚Äôt had more than three full sentences from her but she‚Äôs planned this whole trip to go visit a friend, not even family?

I just don‚Äôt get it. I mean, I do. It‚Äôs easier to compartmentalize the grief you have for a friend. She can‚Äôt do that with me. Or our parents. But what the fuck, man. You are 54 years old. I‚Äôve been doing this trauma work for 20 years. It‚Äôs not like you haven‚Äôt seen the examples, and the fruit. But she won‚Äôt do it herself. She‚Äôs too afraid. 

I know I shouldn‚Äôt look extrinsically for comfort or validation or reasons to like stay and put up with a failing body and very difficult mental health struggles around it, but when your family treats perfect strangers (her church parishioners) SO MUCH BETTER than she treats her own family, I just have to ask, what‚Äôs the point? Who am I here for? [The answer for now is my parents, but that‚Äôs wearing very thin the sicker I get and the stupider our country gets]

I just want to shake her and say Who Do You Think I Am? If I showed up anonymous at your church one Sunday would you treat me better than you do now? And don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs a problem?

Anybody who made it this far, thanks for reading my rant. When you grow up with a big sister who promises the world and then keeps that promise to everyone but you, it really, really sucks. I appreciate the chance to get all that out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1e1bv49/do_any_of_you_have_family_who_are_available_for/,1720770208.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1e4cb5q,ChronicIllness,Dreading the next medication step down,"It's been a rough year with almost 6 months of med changes and adjustments, 2 hospitalizations, and finally catching Covid. I still have a bit more to go as I continue to wean off Klonopin.  My neuro dropped that bombshell on me in May when I was finally doing well and it was hell the first 5 weeks. My primary wouldn't adjust my Nortriptyline without seeing him so I had 5 weeks of horrible sleep. He upped it when I saw him earlier this month.  Now I am finally feeling better but do my next Klonopin step down tomorrow night. I expect many nights of bad sleep since it's been bad the past 3 days. Not looking forward to it at all and will have to do more during the day to tire myself out. I just need to get back to caring for my mom during the day.  She has Alzheimer's and I am so upset about missing the past six months of being with four days all day. That's all that time I can't get back. I am just struggling to cope mentally some days. And I feel bad that my sisters have had to pick up the slack with me not being able to help. I literally had 5 months of barely being able to get of bed.

m8urwq,ChronicIllness,Resources for chronically ill undiagnosed people,"Hello Everyone! I‚Äôve seen a lot of similar posts to mine, but haven‚Äôt seen any responses that I haven‚Äôt already tried so I‚Äôm hoping for ideas.

I am 29/F who has been chronically ill for 12 years. I have racked up a lot of diagnoses like POTS, small fiber neuropathy, etc. but I‚Äôm constantly told I‚Äôm not sick enough to qualify for any help because I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt have Alzheimer‚Äôs/ need full time nursing care. 

This year I‚Äôve cut my work to part time and struggling to work 20 hours remotely. I am basically home bound. I have finally admitted to myself that I need help doing some things around the house and managing my health care. In the past month I‚Äôve been in the er, urgent care, etc. and have lost about 40 lbs and am unable to do basic self care things as often as needed. Fun fact, part time employees aren‚Äôt eligible for fmla coverage, as I am sure many of you know. 

I asked my doctor about disability and was told she wouldn‚Äôt send in the application until I had a stronger diagnosis and keeps saying maybe after the next test, I‚Äôve tried to connect with social workers/ patient navigators through the hospital and am told their schedules were full. So I called my local aging and disability office and was told it was a no go. I‚Äôve also been told by the social worker I wouldn‚Äôt qualify for meals on wheels. I‚Äôm getting really desperate because I‚Äôm in immediate need of help but I am constantly told without a diagnosis there is no help/ social safety nets available.  I have to keep working to keep health insurance, so basically my only solution is keeping a puke bucket outside of my computers camera view and do the old puke and rally bit during meetings and am ordering delivery food because I can‚Äôt get out, which isn‚Äôt healthy or cheap.

Those with undiagnosed chronic conditions, are there any resources that you have found helpful/ accepting of younger applicants?

13tp0ig,ChronicIllness,My partner says her brain is broken and it's not,"My partner gets confused when she rides in a car - kinda like concussion symptoms. She also (rarely) mentally reverts to a previous time in her life, triggered by enormous stress. But the large majority of the time (as in, she hasn't had either of those problems once in more than a month), she is perfectly cognizant, she is aware, she is even smarter than me by a long shot (as she always has been). A LONG time ago (like almost two years ago) she had a period of time when she didn't know who the people around her were, she was scared of sunsets. Those problems went away and didn't come back, but she fears they might one day. She does still have trouble recognizing her emotions now, but having trouble recognizing emotions is something I've struggled with all my life, being autistic, so I wouldn't call that broken - just more detached from her feelings than she used to be. And I'm sure that sucks, but it doesn't make us broken.

Today she told me her brain is broken. I told her that it might be working a little differently than it used to, which does suck, but it's far from broken - she is able to make decisions for herself, she is able to tell us what she needs, she is able to research her own condition - her brain works better than mine the majority of the time, so I can't really agree that her brain is broken. So I tried to guess why she was calling it broken - I pointed out that people with autism (to a worse degree than me, thankfully) struggle CONSTANTLY with cognition problems that are ""worse"" than hers (by the scale she seemed to be using - she said it's like a toaster that always burns the toast, it functions but not correctly; I think a comparison like that would require some objective standard that humans are ""supposed"" to reach, which is kind of absurd) and these other people don't call themselves broken, just different. So I guessed that maybe it's a subjective thing - she feels broken because unlike with autism, this isn't her baseline, it's not what she's used to, so SUBJECTIVELY, it feels broken. She said I was wrong and it's objectively broken. She told me that it's not like autism - it's an illness like Alzheimers or cancer (I tried to point out that in the more severe forms, autism IS an illness, but again, her cognitive issues are not at that level). I responded that having the occasional episode of a flashback a few times a year or getting confused after riding in a car is NOT the same as Alzheimers and her physical symptoms - which she does have many and a few of them are similar to chemo symptoms - are NOT the same as having cancer. 

I told her that if she wants to say her body is broken, then fine - she's pretty much bed ridden (not technically, she can usually make it around the house or at least the same floor her bedroom is on, but some days she literally can't leave the bed and ""housebound"" sounds a little too light, considering sometimes even if she can leave the bed she can't get more than a few feet from her bedroom, so close enough). She wants to complain about her hands not working properly, her ears not working properly, her gut not working properly, her central nervous system not working properly - fine. I'm not denying that she is suffering - of course she is. But her brain is (blissfully) one of the few things we can still generally count on. Her brain is not what's broken. 

But for some reason, this is really upsetting her. And her being upset makes me upset too. And I don't understand why I have to agree that her occasional mental blip is the same as Alzheimers. Is her brain working the same way it used to? No - it's definitely working differently, especially when it comes to emotional processing. Is it objectively outright broken? No - and thank the gods it's not because I need her brain to keep working. Why is it so terrible to acknowledge that there is ONE thing that isn't generally a problem? Seriously, she has so much she could complain about that I agree with, so many problems and so much suffering and it's so unfair. But it's also not fair to claim her BRAIN is broken and compare herself to people who literally can't make any choices for themself, don't know who their relatives are - much less be cognizant enough to research their condition and make their own medical decisions. How can I explain to her that it's ok to acknowledge that not EVERYTHING is broken? Why doesn't she understand that brain function is MORE than just being detached from your emotions and randomly getting confused a few times a year? I love her, and I know she's suffering and I'm right here next to her watching it every single day - and I'm so grateful her brain is still working because I don't know what I'd do if it wasn't. Why does she have to fight that? If she subjectively feels like it's broken, then I accept that, but why does she act like I need to agree that it's OBJECTIVELY something that it's just not...?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/13tp0ig/my_partner_says_her_brain_is_broken_and_its_not/,1685240625.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
101h7w0,ChronicIllness,I am pushing myself to far and don't know what to do.,"For background, I have mild Systemic Scleroderma, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Fibro, and a few other things.  My meds cause severe brain fog and the pain can makes my sleep very erratic. I am 49F. Also, I tend to be very long winded, so apologies. Thank you for being a place of understanding. 

I had a period where I was feeling much better so I started helping get a new martial arts school off the ground by teaching the itty bitties movement classes, and some special classes. I have assistants, so I am not pounding my body on the mats, just using my mind. It has been good for my mental health in many ways and has been a nice way to reconnect post pandemic with a lot of people I use to train with. When I am up to it, I take classes - because of my relative seniority they understand I need to self modify the intensity and some skills. 

I also help two mornings a week with my MIL as she battles Alzheimer's and while my own parents still do very well, I spend a morning or two a week with them since the pandemic. Mom and I craft and sew while I am there.  

Then came the holidays and out of town family and festivities.  My house is a mess! I teach in a couple of hours. I can feel my body edging back toward the point where I was in bed for days at a time.  I make a commitment for the long term, I do everything I can to not back out.  I am afraid - of ending up bed bound for days, or worse, hospitalized.  I know I have over committed again as I did for years before the health issues.  I just don't know how to balance it all out again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/101h7w0/i_am_pushing_myself_to_far_and_dont_know_what_to/,1672678177.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I am aware that many of these medications come with a number of side effects. All symptoms and testing that I will talk about has been done after any medication has been out of my system for an extended period of time. My symptoms also appear to be cyclical. I have tried moving, and I have tried going to warm, sunny locations close to the equator during the winter time when my symptoms seem to exaccerbate. Climate, sunlight, and humidity make no difference in when my symptoms appear and the severity of them. I have tried moving out of the country to many different places. I have tried every supplement you can think of. I have tried meditation, yoga, therapy, diet changes. I eat a vegan diet. I was not vegan when this began. The vegan diet helps with my IBS symptoms. I take mulivitamins and drink protein shakes. My blood work, besides the things that have always come back abnormal, such as creatin and cholesterol, remain unchanged before and after the vegan diet. I do not smoke or use alcohol or drugs. I get exercise everyday and do physical therapy. 

Now for the long, boring part.
I'm not exactly sure when I got sick, or what may or may not be important. So I'll start with the first few times I felt sick.
When I was 11, I got mono. I was out of school for months. I got mono 3 more times over the course of a 3 year period. I never felt the same after that. I had less stamina, and was exhausted.
I began menstruating at 11, and my periods were lasting about 8 months. They were extremely heavy, and I was becoming anemic. They diagnosed me with Von Willibrands Hemophilia, which I would later find out was a misdiagnosis due to improperly run tests. I was put on birth control to help with the periods. It did help. 

When I was 19, I was out with my mom and step dad at a diamond mine and I felt unwell. I felt confused, disoriented, exhausted, and had a headache. I assumed I was dehydrated. I got a bunch of spots on back, shoulders, chest, and abdomen that were oblong and red. They were slightly red. They were quarter sized. They did not itch or hurt.

They lasted for about a month. Nothing made them better or worse. We tried antifungals. I never felt right after that day. The fatigue got worse by the day. I developed painful, enlarged lymph nodes on the back of my neck. My doctor thought maybe I had Lyme disease, so he put me on doxycycline just in case. It made no difference. 


I began having episodes where I would suddenly get very disoriented and not know where I was, even if I was in a familiar place. Time seemed to slow down or speed up, I'm not sure which. I couldn't see quite right, though I can't pinpoint exactly what wasn't right. I would zone out and become almost catatonic. They would last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. I would usually have to lay down. Sometimes I would just fall asleep right where I was. They suspected it was some sort of anxiety attack, so I was put on antidepressants and anti anxiety medication. They didn't help with these episodes. 

I started to have digestive issues, much like I did when I was a small child. Anytime I would eat, I would get stomach pains, and very bad diarrhea. I lost 40 pounds in a couple of months. It was not c-diff, parasites, or a bacterial imbalance. After about 8 months, it stopped. 

The episodes would go away for a year, then return. Each time, they would return for longer periods of time. They would be more intense, and they were becoming closer and closer together. When I was 22, I went off birth control to make sure this wasn't a hormonal side effect. My menses did not return until this year, and they are very light. My period will happen for 2 days, stop for 2, and then start again for 3. They come about every 6-8 weeks. Sometimes I will have a menstrual cycle 2 weeks after my last, but that is rare. 

When I was 24, the episodes were almost constant. I had chronic headaches and migraines. I was sleeping for 22 hours a day when I could. I worked as a funeral director (and no, this is not a result of exposure to any harmful agents I worked with or BBP's, I have been tested). I started working at a pet store after working as a funeral director didn't work out. I was a manager. My boss had to demote me, because she was concerned about my condition. I did not think anything was wrong with me, except that I was tired. She noted I had personality changes, and would become easily angered and aggressive, which is not my nature. She noted I was losing strength, and could no longer lift and carry things I could a few months prior. She said my gait was becoming staggered. She said I could no longer multitask, and I seemed confused and disoriented. I didn't believe her, or I didn't want to. On three separate occasions, I left the cash registers open, full of cash, and the front doors to the store unlocked. I don't remember doing this. After that, she showed me security camera tapes of me standing in corners of the room, for 20 minutes or more, not moving at all. You could see customers try to interact with me, and I was catatonic. A month later, I had a grand mal seizure. 

The seizure led me to an MRI where they called me in immediately and told me I had a brain tumor. I was sent to oncology, and they put me on a high dose of dexamethasone to slow the growth of the tumor until we knew what we were dealing with. They wanted to do a biopsy. I refused. The MRI also revealed a number of white matter brain lesions. I also had an arachnoid, a bundle of abnormal veins. These are usually harmless, but can cause anyuerisms. In going back to an MRI I had when I was 8 after a bad concussion, it was confirmed this vascular anomaly was present then, so I was most likely born with it. 

I got a repeat MRI a month later, and the tumor had not grown, and the lesions had significantly reduced in size, althoug had left me with some scarring. 

I was taken off dexamethasone and within a few months, my condition rapidly declined. Soon, I lost the ability to walk. It started with right sided weakness, and I would fall a lot. One day, I couldn't get back up. I was bound to a wheelchair for almost a year, and through rigorous physical therapy, learned to walk with a crutch. I walked with a crutch for 3 years. Although my spinal taps and other tests came back negative for MS, the only concrete thing the doctors had were images of my brain, which had some white matter lesions, so they thought maybe I had MS. I guess in rare cases, testing can come up negative for MS when you still have it. I saw an MS specialist, and she suggested I try a medicine for MS, which was fairly benign in nature with few side effects. It didn't work. 

I began to have trouble urinating and emptying my bladder. The episodes were worse than ever, and I would not be able to communicate in complete sentences while they were happening. I developed severe tremors in my right hand, and the left side of my face. My left eye was drooping, and blinked slowly compared to the right. I lost almost all vision in my left eye, althougn there was nothing structurally wrong with my eye. I developed raynaud's phenomenon. During these episodes, which were happening usually around 3 pm everyday, my fingers and toes would turn blue, my lips would turn blue, and my veins would collapse to a point where they could not draw blood. During one episode at my doctors office, I lost conciousness and woke up in the Neuro ICU where I would remain for quite some time. 

They ran multiple tests and LP's, and I was constantly hooked up to machines. I was confused, and would answer questions like ""middle"" for noon when being asked what time it was. I couldn't write because of tremors and confusion. I was constantly having taccychardic episodes where my heart rate would go to 165 bpm, even when I wasn't moving. There is nothing structurally wrong with my heart, and we have ruled out medication as being the cause. I was constantly hooked up to an EKG, and the ruled out seizures.

For some unknown reason, while in the ICU, I felt a little better one day. After being a little more stable for a couple of days, I was allowed to go home. I was not on any medicine that caused me to feel better. 

Months went by with tons of physical therapy, and I started to learn how to walk. Then one day, the episodes returned, this time, with hallucinations. I would feel as if there was warm water dripping from the ceiling onto my skin. I thought I saw my house on fire. I thought I saw myself walking down the road, and it was confirmed that no one was there. I would think that I was other people in stores and such, and would ask things like ""how did I get over there?"" even when the people did not look anything like me. I became paranoid and aggressive. I thought the people around me were poisioning me, and I started to become physically violent. I couldn't eat because I would choke on my food. I got another MRI, and my brain had lesions on it again. I was put on a very high dose of prednisone, and my symptoms got better. 

I went off the steroids again, and felt pretty good for a while. I was learning to write, talk, eat, walk, and even drive again. Things started to look up for a while. Then the headaches came. These headaches were like nothing else I can describe. They were similar to when you have a CSF leak from a botched LP, (and trust me, I've had my fair share), where the pain is excruciating and you go blind and deaf if you lift your head. These headaches were 50x more intense than any migraine I've ever had. They usually started on the back, right side of my head, near the occiptal bone, and went up over my right ear to the top of my left eye near my sinuses.Oxygen therapy helped a little tiny bit while I was using it. Even oxycodone wouldn't touch it. They diagnosed me with cluster headaches. They would gradually turn into pain all over my head. I would get goosebumps in weird patterns on my legs that would rise and fall every few seconds. I started having severe diarrhea, that was green and slimy. I could no longer have any oil, it made it worse. I lost 35 pounds and got down to 87 pounds. Eventually, the diarrhea stopped, and I developed white stools. My eyes turned yellow. Blood work showed I have primary billiary cirhosis. I was transferred to Mass general hospital in Boston. While there, my stools started to change back to a normal color after a week of being white, and my blood work no longer showed positive for cirrhosis. However, my mitochondrial AB was abnormally high, and testing and imaging showed I had fatty liver disease. I had been abstinent from alcohol for 2 years at this point, and my liver showed no damage during the times I had been drinking in college. I was not using a lot of tylenol or other medications that damage the liver. I developed white patches on my skin that looked like hypopigmentation. They would come and go. 

My lymph nodes again became swollen and painful. They were so large, they stuck out of my skin like implants. I had a biopsy, and it was shown that they were reactive, but not specifically why. 

More lesions, and another round of prednisone later, I decided to go off of the steriods I had been on for 6 months to give my adrenal glands a break. The fatigue was worse than ever, and I became so bloated and constipated, I looked pregnant. My menses once again stopped. The stomach pain was excruciating, and I couldn't pass gas. My skin broke out in painful acne. I figured it was an adrenal insufficency, but my tests showed otherwise. My adrenal system is in suprisingly good shape for the amount of steroids I've been on. The stomach issues lasted for 6 months. One day they were better, as a matter of fact, it was right after my periods started again. I thought all was well until over the summer, the stomach problems came back with a vengence. I was so constipated, I had a back up that was 5 feet long. I had to do 2 bowel preps for a colonoscopy in order to have a bowel movement. I felt constantly hungry, but not in my stomach, in my mouth, if that makes any sense. I was craving sweets and carbs, things I've never really liked. My skin began to constantly burn, especially on my face. My tongue and teeth would tingle.I woild choke on all of my food.  Those things were worse when I ate. I got a repeat endoscopy, and it was unremarkable.  This lasted for another 6 months. It subsided, and is starting to happen again. However, the pain is now in the lower left and right quadrant of the abdomen, where the ovaries are. I feel a constant, painful, tearing sensation in those areas, even when my stomach isnt that bad. They are visibly swollen. An ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound showed nothing in my ovaries. The top joints on my fingers and toes become red, and very swollen. They ache. 

So, now my circulation is worse than ever. My toes are starting to look borderline necrotic, and unless someone massages blood into my feet, they are a deep purple. It is very painful. A few of the toes that hurt the most became very swollen and red for a while, but now I can't really feel them. They are wrinkly and the skin is peeling on them. My lymph nodes began to swell again. I started to have visual hallucinations.  My digestion sucks and I'm having stomach pains and distention again. I decided to go back on prednisone. I started at 10 mg for one month, which did nothing. I recently bumped it up to 20, and my circulation will ocassionally seem a bit better, where you can actually see my veins. I am slightly less tired, and I don't hurt as much. In the past, I have been on 60 mg of prednisone before seeing any good results. However, I‚Äôm very young and that dosage of steroids for a long time won‚Äôt take long to kill me.

I am currently awaiting approval for some tests to check for vasculitis. 

Thank you for your time.

1ctnbk4,ChronicIllness,Is anyone else actually dying or standing to face horrific fates like dementia or paralysis?,"Let me start by saying the comparison game is useless and EVERYONE‚ÄôS pain is valid, this discussion is NOT for putting down certain conditions as being not so bad or insinuating people who aren‚Äôt actively dying shouldn‚Äôt be so sad or struggling, etc

That being said - as someone who has more common and benign conditions like dysautonomia and hypermobility in addition to a very sinister disease (described below), I feel so alone in these communities because the vastly majority of people will still live normal lifespans without particularly grotesque fates.

I have an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease which is believed to have vascular and autoimmune components, my mom has the same illness and has gradually declined over 15 years to the point she‚Äôs completely demented at age 65. It‚Äôs been the most horrific experience of my life to watch her suffer (and be one of her caretakers) while knowing that‚Äôs also my fate and not having real answers. It‚Äôs so lonely facing this sort of fate at such a young age and with a condition that‚Äôs not common or even known! Doctors are stumped. It‚Äôs brutal.

I feel so alone amongst discussions of eating more salt and wearing supportive braces and I find myself wishing I could hope to live a remotely normal life with measures like adding yummy foods to my diet and that POTS was my only demon. And then I feel guilty for being bitter and I feel even worse because I know that mentality isn‚Äôt helpful.

So I finally got the courage to start a thread here asking if anyone else here also has a more serious condition that is either life limiting or will lead to a fate that most people consider to be the worst thing that could happen to a person- dementia, paralysis, total loss of senses or function, etc. I‚Äôm desperately needing to not feel alone right now.

1fc4e0v,ChronicIllness,My father has dementia and struggles to comprehend most things. One of the few things he understands is NFL. Everything to do with NFL. It's his only hobby.,"I'd love to:

1) Find a service that actually has all of the games. We live in South Florida, and he is a huge Miami Dolphins fan, win or lose. But, he loves ALL NFL football. AFC, NFC, it doesn't really matter. Youtube TV? He currently has and pays for Comcast Xfinity.

2) A larger, clearer display with a decent panel. NO TVs or anything the size of a laptop. He wants it to be able to hold it I. his hands. Some Android tablet? iPad? Something else?

As he's suffering from dementia and other issues. I want to make the last few remaining years of his life as enjoyable as possible for him, so money is not an issue here. Thank you.


UPDATE:

I got NFL Sunday Ticket + RedZone for $200 with a military discount, and YouTube TV, which came with 4 months of Max for free (for Hard Knocks).

I bought a Galaxy Tab A9+ and an S9, both with rugged cases. He chose the A9+ since the stylus on the S9 confused him. I logged him into Max, YouTube TV, set all Dolphins games to record, added him to my Prime family, and saved his passwords in his Google and Samsung accounts after cleaning out old ones. I also set up unattended remote access to his devices with TeamViewer and AnyDesk.

I rewired his coax setup, removing splitters to boost his internet speed to 1350 Mbps (he was only getting 300 before). I also upgraded his streaming to 4K and put his modem on a battery backup. Plus, I gave him extra chargers and cables.

He was in tears and said having this setup with such a big, easy-to-use screen means more to him than the Dolphins winning every game this season. Even with their rough start, he considers this the best season he's watched in decades.

1cn64rh,ChronicIllness,I‚Äôm so tired of ppl thinking being young means your ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù,"My doctor is wanting me to try physical therapy and I had my first appointment today. The lady kept referring to me as a ‚Äúhealthy kid‚Äù. Saying I will need to ‚Äúremind‚Äù them that I have health issues because they can‚Äôt tell by looking at me. I get it I‚Äôm the youngest person there, normally people my age are healthy blah blah blah. But why would I be here if I was healthy? I don‚Äôt have an injury of any kind. The old people there aren‚Äôt necessarily unhealthy just old so obviously they have problems with joints and strength and such. The only reason a young person would be there is if they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or had an injury. 

I‚Äôm just so tired of people not taking me seriously just because I‚Äôm 19. Like yes I SHOULD be healthy and I may look healthy but I am NOT. None of my family took me serious and some of my doctors just look at me as a dramatic child. It pisses me off so so bad. I had to move out and was paying bills at 17. I had to raise myself bc my dad was immature and my mom was running the streets doing dope. I had to graduate early. I couldn‚Äôt go to the doctor until I was 18. I finally got my shit together and am racking up medical bills trying to figure out what my parents should have. All that just to be looked at as if I‚Äôm a child who doesn‚Äôt know anything and doesn‚Äôt have problems. 

My dad‚Äôs voice follows me everywhere I go. I‚Äôm always telling myself I‚Äôm being dramatic and that I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs so hard to come to terms with the fact my own dad ignored my medical issues. Ik people don‚Äôt know my story or my issues by looking at me. But I‚Äôm not paying thousands of dollars for all these doctors and tests and treatments for fun.

1i2dy77,ChronicIllness,I have fractures in my spine nobody told me about till 5 months after imaging,"Earlier last year I started experiencing more frequent and more intense sciatica pain. I went to my pcp who ordered x-rays and PT. Never heard anything back about the x-rays and PT said it was just ""tight muscles."" By the end of the year I was in so much pain throughout my entire back and neck that it left me bedridden for a while.

On Christmas Eve I saw a new doctor as I decided to switch my primary care. One of the first things she says is ""were you aware that you have chronic fractures in your L5?"" I was shocked. She showed me the x-ray report and sure enough, I have ""chronic-appearing pars interarticularis fractures in L5"".

Reminds me of how a year prior to having a thyroid storm, a doctor had checked my labs and didn't tell me my TSH was so low it was undetectable. I went a whole year suffering thinking I was legitimately developing dementia at 20-something when I was just hyperthyroid the whole time. After that I always made it a point to check my own labs but for some reason I just didn't think to check imaging reports.

I wonder how different my health issues would've played out if doctors just fucking told me about the things that are wrong before they get worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1i2dy77/i_have_fractures_in_my_spine_nobody_told_me_about/,1736992327.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
1kqofog,ChronicIllness,My spirit is so weak this time around.,"I just need a place to put my thoughts down, feel free to ignore this post.

I have been admitted to the hospital since Friday afternoon after i passed out/fell at home and split my chin open on the counter.  I have an extremely rare genetic disease that is causing my immune system to attack my brain.  I am legally blind now and can't really walk much anymore, except with my KAFOs (full leg braces) for short distances.

PT and OT are both recommending inpatient rehab so i can be safer at home (this is my 7th fall in 6 months, 3 requiring medical attention).  My rehab doctor who i have been seeing for a year now woke me up this morning for an evaluation.  Great, fine i've been waiting all weekend for this.  I needed her evaluation so she could put in orders for inpatient therapy so they can start working on my placement.

Y'all.  This woman shattered my heart into a million pieces in less than 8 minutes.  Without doing much evaluation or asking me really any questions, she abruptly said verbatim: ""sending you to inpatient rehab will be a waste of time because you will never get better.  Your legs will not get stronger, so inpatient rehab would be rather useless.""  I tried to explain the other recommendations and that i am not looking to get better, i'm looking to get *safer.*  She cut me off and again told me that i will not get better so there is no point in doing inpatient therapy.  She already made up her mind before she ever stepped foot in my cubby.

Eventually, she said: ""i know you have already told me why you aren't able to do outpatient rehab, but if you *really* wanted to try therapy again anyway, this ideally needs to be handled outpatient.""  She didn't seem to care or be concerned about the fact PT/OT *both* recommended inpatient therapy.

After she left, my nurse caught me silently crying in my cubby (it's not a real room, there is no door only a heavy curtain).  I told her what the doctor said and she was so kind.  She helped calm me down, reminded me what my care goals were, and validated my feelings that inpatient therapy would be best for me.  I told her i felt like the doctor is giving up on me, and she helped me identify all the reasons i should not give up on myself.

Later, the rep from a nursing home one county over came to see me, since multiple referrals were placed when i was in the ER.  She was extremely nice and said they would accept me for rehab, but it is an actual nursing home and senior living facility.  I am only 33, but she confirmed i would have to share a room with someone's grandma, and i would likely get roomed with a dementia patient.  The thought of spending 3-4 weeks in a nursing home instead of enjoying the start of summer with my wife and kids is more than i can handle.

And to add insult to injury, i have a wheat allergy so i can only eat like 4 meals from the hospital cafeteria, and they are all *absolutely disgusting.*  Things have been very difficult financially for my wife and i with my illness and expenses, and she is hopefully buying us a car today.  We need every cent we have for the down payment, so i don't have the funds to order delivery.  I've been skipping meals because i can only force myself to eat the gross food once a day.  I guess at least i will lose weight and can start working in my summer body.

Listen.  Am i going to have baby giraffe legs forever?  Yeah, probably.  Is my disease incurable and untreatable?  Yup, seems that way.

Am i worth giving up on?  Absolute not.  Thanks for reading.  I just needed to get my emotions out.  My spirit has never been this weak, and i have a very long way to go before i can go home.  All i want is a shower and a hot bowl of pho.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1kqofog/my_spirit_is_so_weak_this_time_around/,1747691753.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Me, acute - mold exposure, antibiotic resistant bacteria (Klebsiella aerogenes), these likely both came from mold growth out of a sewage water flood in my apartment building, shitty landlords didn't clean it well, bedroom became mustier and mustier last 6 months of living there, COVID for the 4th, extreme constipation, mucus in stool, inflammation of the colon, potential hormones imbalance, enlarged adenoids, stuck feeling in throat, ear pain, eustachian tube disfunction, ringing in ears, eye pain, light and sound senstivity, adhd-like symptoms, memory decline, new allergy development, mood, panic, dehydration, occasional nicotine use in oral form, THC dependent for pain, oral edible form, disordered eating, OCD-like symptoms, counting letters, adding and subtracting license plate numbers, constant tapping and counting fingers, full feeling in head, think it's lymph node drainage issues, voice echoing in head, gray residue leeching out of skin during bath, oily, difficulty regulating temperature, often feel very cold or very hot

I have a bunch of blood tests done as well. There's a lot that's out of wack, specifically levels of blood cells in my blood, inflammation markers, and kidney function levels. I've been to the ER 4 times for issues probably related to this structural infection in my adenoids. First was towards the beginning. I had just tested positive for covid and it was feeling like covid but then it took a weird turn. I got the strongest weirdest pain zapping in my right cheek. It was the trigeminal nerve. It has somehow been affected by covid+

Treatment - 3 antibiotics attempted, all helped temporarily and rebounded, just started metronidazole to target stomach (thoughts on if a 4th antibiotic is a good move?) Prednisone dose pack, 10 day, helped some, probiotics, magnesium oxide, fexofenadine, famotidine prn, chlorpheniramine prn, fish oil, NAC, magnesium citrate, enema x2, organism for happy chemicals and muscle relaxation, THC, nicotine, stretching and heat on abdomen, lymphatic drainage work, moving out of moldy apartment and deep cleaning all soft surfaces

*deep breath* I've got more lil if u r still reading this far down, u a real one fr 

I was out a PCP for most of this time when I was experiencing chronic symptoms bc of insurance and employment issues. I relied way too heavily on urgent care. I was just getting temporary bandaids for the bad boo boos along the way, but there was something bad brewing underneath. 

I had several doctor dismiss symptoms of these chronic issues. I unintentionally lost ~75 pounds in a year and my first adult PCP said it was nothing to worry about. He also prescribed me cyclobenzaprine for my TMJ but he did not take it seriously at all. 

Slowly after COVID lockdown ended I gained all that weight back + 25 more lbs. I was not eating well and binging fast food a lot. My brain to stomach connection was thrown way off. It really became scary at some times :/ the one consistent practitioner i had during this period was (and is still) a physicians assistant specializing in mental health disorders. She is who diagnosed me in 2019. 

My theory is that my family has some kind of trait on my mother's side that affects the development of structures of the face, maybe bc of connective tissues malfunction. There are many examples of unique ways it has manifest in family members. I had genetic potential to have something off structurally in my head. 

I believe it is the adenoid lymph nodes in the top of the mouth. The structural issue could affect other tissue that is in the head and neck by pressing on it or causing inflammation that neighboring structures have to deal with, It can also block the airway while sleeping. I've had very bad sleep apnea for some time. It really started affecting me in college. I had a terribly hard time waking up for and staying awake throughout 8ams. This was during the school year, but in the summers I was spending time in the blue ridge parkway area. Breathing in clean air, running around in creeks, exercising a lot. 

During the summers I felt great. I was even likely manic at least 2 summers bc I was running on 6 hrs of sleep on average and still making it through an exhausting 14 hr day of physical movement. I was also highly emotionally sensitive during this time, during the school year and in the summers. Diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2019 at 24 years old. 

Picked up a smoking habit in 2018, cigarettes and weed. Have been pretty dependent on nicotine and THC since then for self medicated pain management and appetite. I have gone in and out of harsh addiction and smoking several a day (during 2020), to using just oral nicotine like mints or powder packets. I used a vape too. I was completely nicotine free for 6 months before the infection :/ now I'm back on orals.  

I imagine smoking can gunk up adenoids that are already enlarged and essentially create an open wound begging to get infected.

I've lost jobs bc of my sleep and mood issues. I have simply slept thru many shifts at several different jobs. And bc of panic attacks right before a shift. My resume is a mess. I'm a fairly smart person. I feel like that is clear in the amount of research I've done for this theory. Despite being very smart I have failed out of 2 masters programs bc of sleep and mood issues. I've had my current job for 1.5 years. It's the longest I've been anywhere since high school, except one other job but it was WFH during covid so. I haven't accomplished much in life bc of these symptoms holding me back. 

I studied anatomy in college bc I originally wanted to be a nurse. And one of the masters programs was for psychology so I am sorta familiar with the structures of the face and brain. 

Once the dots connected and I realized what was happening, I'm viewing my life through a lense of this kind of condition and it is astounding how much this has probably affected me. 

Oh my gosh this is long haha *deep breath* 

I've just been collecting so much information and holding a lot of thoughts in my head that I'm realizing could all fit together. 

So what do you think? Medical mystery solved, yeah?

1drdxbz,ChronicIllness,Someone please hear me. Please believe me.,"I know that so many people have been dealing with health issues for much longer than I have. This is my first post in this community, so I hope that it‚Äôs appropriate. I‚Äôm looking for advice, help, validation, whatever you can give. Warning that this will be long - there is a TLDR at the end.

I‚Äôve been having issues with daytime sleepiness since I was a teenager. I was finally diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia by a neurologist about six years ago. I take Adderall daily for this. It worked great for me for 4 years. About a year and 9 months ago, I got pregnant and had to discontinue.

I restarted it a few weeks after I gave birth. I noticed right away that it wasn‚Äôt as effective, but I just chalked it up to the fact that I was a new parent getting no sleep. 

My son was born in June 2023. The first three months I was mostly holed up in the house. At three months, I went back to work and he started daycare. The constant sickness started. Between September 2023 and now, I‚Äôve been sick at least 10 times with every infectious illness you can imagine. Sometimes my son wouldn‚Äôt even show symptoms, and my husband wouldn‚Äôt always get sick either.

Again, I chalked it up to poor sleep. And eating less than I used to, unintentionally. I‚Äôve been so busy as a mom working full time plus overtime. I am very lucky to have bosses that are incredibly understanding. There are a lot of places that would have fired me if I took as many sick days as I have.

But about a month ago, things took a turn. Right after my son turned one, I started to experience what I can only describe as ‚Äúall kinds of weird symptoms.‚Äú

I had caught a cold, so at first I just thought the relentless fatigue was from that. But I know the experience of infectious illness well, and it was different.

As the cold symptoms started to subside, the ‚Äúweird‚Äù symptoms started to get worse. I noticed that I had a low-grade fever in the 99s that was going up and down all day. It‚Äôs been about a week and a half and it‚Äôs still happening.

I guess I‚Äôll just list my symptoms below since I don‚Äôt even know how to make a timeline out of it. It seems like some of them come and go within a day. And the mental fog doesn‚Äôt make me the best historian.

- The worst all over body and joint pain that I‚Äôve ever felt. I woke up one day and instantly called into work. My husband had to help me out of bed. It was worse in my neck, but still bad everywhere else.

- Bizarre sensations in my arms and hands that I can only describe as hypersensitivity

- Weakness. Mainly in my legs, but my arms and hands as well. To the point where I felt like I could barely carry my son or climb stairs. Or even get out of bed.

- Bad night sweats, but that‚Äôs been going on for well over a month now.

- Headaches. Worse when my body pain or weakness is worst. I don‚Äôt usually get headaches.

- Confusion and poor memory. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but feels like I‚Äôm in a dream.

- Not sure if this is even relevant, but I had really bad all-over itching for a few days every couple of weeks, a few months back. It was bizarre. Bad enough that I was scratching all over and felt like I was going crazy. And then it was just..gone. rarely, I‚Äôll randomly get a small patch of itchy skin and/or hives on my wrist or my hips. But that was ALL over.

- Swelling in my hands, mainly just my right hand. Enough that it was noticeable. That only lasted for a little over half the day one day this past week.

- Extreme fatigue. I have a sleep disorder as I mentioned, so I‚Äôm used to being tired. This is different. I could have two energy drinks in a day and take my Adderall as usual, and nothing touches it. Getting out of bed in the morning is the hardest it‚Äôs been in years.

- Random muscle twitches, spasms, and tingling. Very minor and goes away quickly.

- Horrible nausea, worst in the morning. To the point where I would dry heave, and then it would typically go away in a few hours. But I don‚Äôt know if it was really ‚Äúgoing away,‚Äù because I get a Zofran prescription from my neurologist for occasional morning nausea and I took those every time it was bad.

- No appetite for days. It wasn‚Äôt like it was really being fueled by the nausea, although that didn‚Äôt help. I still didn‚Äôt feel hungry even when I wasn‚Äôt nauseous. It was like my stomach just stopped caring about food. A couple of days ago, my appetite came back with a vengeance, and I felt starving.

- Unintentional weight loss. I gained 60 pounds during pregnancy, all of which I lost within 10 months postpartum. Chalked that up to the Adderall, which does have a tendency to make me drop weight pretty quickly. And eating less than I used to. But I could feel my clothes hanging off of me as of a few weeks ago, so I decided to check the scale. 125. OK, that was pretty much what I was at before pregnancy. Then a few days ago, I checked again. Just over 120. I haven‚Äôt weighed that since I was 15 years old. I‚Äôm 28.

There‚Äôs more, but I‚Äôm really struggling to remember it all.

When I woke up with the unbearable body pain, I immediately called into work and called my primary care. They were able to get me in same day with a different doctor than I usually see. I told him all of my symptoms, at least those that I could remember. He said there was fullness in my right ear, and basically told me it was likely from the cold. Asked me if I had tested for Covid and the flu, which I hadn‚Äôt. Told me to take some Aleve or Motrin, and that I would likely feel better in a few days. He re-ordered the routine bloodwork that I hadn‚Äôt gotten done from my annual physical in January, and added folate and B12.

I left with tears in my eyes. I anticipated he wouldn‚Äôt take my concerns seriously, but it was worse than I thought it would be.

I went and got the bloodwork right after my appointment. I was checking for the results on and off, and after three days with no results and worsening symptoms, I decided to call Quest yesterday. They were able to email me my results.

Everything was normal, except my lymphocytes were low. My absolute count was 811 and my percentage blood volume was 10.4.
I did notice that my neutrophils were borderline high, my potassium borderline low, and my TSH and T4 borderline low. The percent volume range for neutrophils was 40 to 80, and mine was 79.8.

Folate, B12, Vitamin D, all beautiful numbers. I got a voicemail from a nurse at my primary later in the day saying my results were normal. I‚Äôm not sure why they told me they were normal when the lymphocytes were low. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because the doctor documented that I had a sinus infection, and they were assuming that my body was responding to that.

This brings us to yesterday afternoon. I started to feel worse and worse. Like I was in a dream again, but worse than before. I felt weak and like I was going to pass out. I decided to leave work early and drive myself to the ER.

It took about four hours to be roomed. I went over all of my symptoms with the NP. She said that my blood work looks great apart from one thing. My potassium was quite low, at 2.9. The usual range is typically 3.5 to 5.3. She explained that all of my symptoms could be explained by the low potassium. Confusion, weakness, tingling, and numbness in my extremities, fatigue, etc. She ordered oral and IV potassium. Said I also look very dehydrated and gave me fluids. Then told me that she wanted to check a couple more things. Gave me a COVID and flu test and more bloodwork for mono. I had mono in high school and I thought you couldn‚Äôt get it again, but didn‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs just a myth. Tests were negative.

I felt a bit better after the potassium infusion, and by then I had been at the hospital for nearly 9 hours and was starving and tired and just done. So I went home, content with the thought that everything was explained. I just need to eat more potassium, as I was instructed with discharge.

When I got home, I updated my husband and my close friend on my diagnosis. Of course, they took to Google. One common denominator in all of the articles about low potassium was that it‚Äôs very unusual to have an acute drop in potassium without any identifiable trigger, such as taking anti-diuretic medication. I really hadn‚Äôt eaten much in the past week though compared to usual, and figured the doctor would know a lot better than me.

This morning, I woke up with nearly all of the same symptoms. 99.5 fever. Arms and legs feel so weak that I don‚Äôt wanna do anything but lay in bed. Headache. I‚Äôve peed about five times this morning, but I‚Äôm guessing my body is still flushing out the fluids from last night. Even though I did two pretty big pees at the hospital lol.

I‚Äôve thought about scheduling an appointment with a rheumatologist, I even called one last week at my dad‚Äòs recommendation. My grandma had rheumatoid arthritis, my dad has MS, and his sister has MS. Based on my dad‚Äôs MRIs, his doctor said he likely had MS for a couple of decades before it was ever caught. So he knows a thing or two about getting dismissed by doctors.

I feel crazy at this point. Could this all be in my head? I have generalized anxiety and depression, but I‚Äôve had that for over a decade. I‚Äôve never been a hypochondriac, the last time I was at the hospital was five years ago for severe constipation.

I‚Äôm tired. For those of you who have gone years with similar symptoms, I don‚Äôt know how you did it, but I hope you at least finally found some answers and help. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a one year old who is getting more mobile by the day. I have a very demanding job. I JUST got a big promotion, and have a lot of hard work coming up. Again, my boss is very understanding, but at the end of the day, I have important people that I have to answer to, including our CFO. And I crawled up the ladder for seven years at this company to get here.

I hope someone here can empathize or relate to what I‚Äôm experiencing. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt afford not to work. And it would crush me to have to stop. I‚Äôm laying here in bed with a headache, feeling so weak. My stomach is cramping. My son is napping and he‚Äôs going to wake up soon.

TLDR: I‚Äôve been having a plethora of weird symptoms for the past month or so that have made it hard to even function, much less keep up with my busy life. I‚Äôve been dismissed by two doctors thus far, and anticipate getting dismissed by more. I need advice. And someone to believe me.

1ey74fj,ChronicIllness,My neurologist did more than years of regular appointments did- in the span of a little over an hour,"24, dealt with chronic pain and exhaustion my entire life. I had some sort of episode a while back that landed me in the ER with dilated pupils, red face, a killer headache (I get maybe one headache a year) and a burning feeling in my throat, along with memory loss and trouble speaking. They gave me ibuprofen and discharged me immediately. The memory issues lasted for months, same with the words. Still I struggle with less grip strength in one hand, and a new lazy eye when I get tired (opposite side of my pre-existing one ofc üôÑ)

It's been half a year, and I saw the neurologist. She comes in, she's a bit older, we get to talking, I show her a photo of my face the day of the incident. She takes a very long and careful look at it, explains it looks like a sympathetic nervous response. She did a lot of tests in-office, from my balance, to memory, to coordination, to reflexes. 

So I talk about my chronic pain. She tests my nerves, ranging from my ability to feel vibrations, to scraping at my hands and feet, to poking each finger- ensures there's no damage, asks me many questions about it. Nothing can really be done neurologically, so she recommends I make the rheumatologist appointment and they should help with that.

I explain repeated head trauma as a child. We both discuss that the preliminary head MRI showed no damage, she did confirms she did double check that pre-appointment without me even asking.

I end up explaining that I get sick easily, am completely out of commission 2ish weeks every time, spent my entire senior year sick. She asks if anyone has ever done immune tests on me- a girl in and out of clinics constantly growing up for being sick with sinus infections- and my answer is no. So she immediately goes ""alright, let's do that then""

I explain the chronic exhaustion. She asks more questions, specific ones. I elaborate when asked. She asks me if I want to get a sleep study done. She tells me that being unable to do the things I want to do/have to do probably impacts the way I view myself and my capabilities (it absolutely destroys my self esteem). I say yes.

She explains one of my vitamins is borderline low, wanted to run a couple more tests for that and start me on the vitamin. I agree.

She explains my signs of a potential reoccurring episode are slim, but she wants to do an EEG to be safe.

Explains some of the tests, if something is wrong, could be impacting my mental health on a larger scale (I'm diagnosed with BPD and was recently inpatient) but they may take a while to get back.

This woman did more for me, listened to me, cared for me, more than **years** of lifetime visits did. I felt heard. For the first time in my life.

1l4cd2n,ChronicIllness,Suspected lupus‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt walk very well without a cane anymore & I‚Äôm scared to use a cane at my rheum appt,"I think I might have lupus ‚Äî and I‚Äôm really nervous for my first rheumatologist appointment‚Ä¶ especially because I‚Äôm having a harder time walking now. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with a ton of symptoms for a while now, and everything‚Äôs been getting worse fast. I‚Äôm finally seeing a rheumatologist soon, but I‚Äôm honestly so anxious and scared I won‚Äôt be taken seriously. 

Here‚Äôs why I think it might be lupus:

* Positive ANA at 1:640 with homogeneous, speckled, and nucleolar patterns

* Low C3 and low-normal C4 complement levels

* Severe, widespread joint pain ‚Äî wrists, hands, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, back ‚Äî without much swelling

* Extreme fatigue, Raynaud‚Äôs, and episodes of fainting

* Confirmed seizures on EEG, plus confusion, memory issues, and bad headaches

* Episodic incontinence where I leak without feeling it 

* Blood and protein in my urine episodically when I don‚Äôt have a uti etc

* Significant weight loss (I‚Äôm down to about 100‚Äì105 lbs at 5‚Äô7‚Äù despite eating)

* Numbness, tingling, and weakness in my limbs

* I also have ulcerative colitis, so autoimmune stuff already runs in my system :(

I‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll brush me off or say it‚Äôs all unrelated, even though my symptoms feel so systemic and connected. Has anyone else gone through something similar before getting diagnosed?

What helped you feel more confident or heard at that first rheumatology appointment? Should I try to go without the cane? I‚Äôm having a really hard time walking and it‚Äôs a big building with a large parking lot. 

I have been barely leaving my house cause I can‚Äôt walk really without a cane‚Ä¶ and I hate people seeing me with my cane and feeling bad for me. Or I worry they think I‚Äôm faking it too.

1l6pgrj,ChronicIllness,My Story,"12 years ago when I first got sick, if you told me I‚Äôd be married and a stay at home mom to my miracle baby girl Liliana - I probably would‚Äôve punched you in the face for giving me false hope. My journey has been ROUGH. Every day I‚Äôm so grateful for how far I‚Äôve come. Looking back it‚Äôs astounding to see what I‚Äôve been through. 

I had a very normal and happy childhood, but got sick when I was 15. I was a sporty and active person. Basketball was my life. I was on the 9th grade basketball team and one day at practice, I was doing a layup and got knocked over while I was jumping and fell, breaking my right foot and hitting my head. I had to be in a calf high boot and was devastated to not be able to play basketball anymore. I still went to all the games and practices to support my team. A couple days before I was supposed to get my boot off, the girls team went to the boys team‚Äôs final game. We were all sitting under the hoop on the floor and I was hugging my legs, knees up to my chest. All was fine and dandy and we were having a good time, until someone from the opposite team dove out of bounds trying to save the ball, and landed right on my foot. The boot cut into my calf and severed the nerves. I wasn‚Äôt able to move my foot for months and it was curved like a banana. I had to do shock therapy to get it moving again and was on crutches for months. Eventually, I was cleared to wear sneakers for half the day. The very first day I was able to do that, I changed out of my boot and into my sneaker right before lunch. My friends and I went to lunch and while we were standing in the lunch line, some kid was running on the lunch table and jumped off landing right on top of my foot. Andddd it broke. Again. And I couldn‚Äôt move it. Again. Months and months more of crutches, physical and shock therapy, and I was able to wear shoes again. A couple days after wearing normal shoes, I was walking in class to get my test results, and my foot just popped and broke. Again. Restarting my progress, again. During all of this, although my broken foot would heal, I‚Äôd still have nerve pain and it would hurt to walk. But luckily that was the last time my right foot broke. 

My basketball career was over. I couldn‚Äôt stand for too long and I definitely couldn‚Äôt run without pain. I lost all my friends for being bitter and depressed because I was in so much pain. No one understood. It didn‚Äôt help that doctors couldn‚Äôt figure out why I still was in so much pain. We did sooo many tests and nerve condition studies (talk about excruciating), yet got no results. Eventually the doctors just ended up telling me I was crazy. It was all in my head. I just wanted attention. My brain was telling me I was in pain, but really I wasn‚Äôt. 

But I found a new passion. I started going to cosmetology school while in high school. It was a new start. New friends. People who didn‚Äôt know about all my injuries. I made it through the first summer school, and the first part of my junior year doing hair while leaning more on my left leg, and sitting down whenever I could. My new friends knew bits and pieces of my story, but I didn‚Äôt go into much detail. I didn‚Äôt want anyone‚Äôs pity. I needed friends. I needed to feel normal. 

One day, I was outside washing my car with my dad and all of a sudden my left foot just popped and broke. Yup, I‚Äôm not joking. Being on crutches for over a year and spending so much time putting all my weight on my left leg, made the foot break from over compensating. The left foot only broke once and although the break healed, the foot and leg continued to have nerve pain it didn‚Äôt have before. Just like the right leg. Now I couldn‚Äôt stand at all without both my legs hurting. I could walk short distances and stand for maybe 3-5 minutes at a time, but that was it. So I had to stop taking clients at school and everyone knew about my past and injuries. Luckily the school still accepted me as a student and I would do mannequin work to get my hours. Eventually after using my arms so much in school, my arms started getting the same nerve pain my legs had. I couldn‚Äôt use my arms more than a couple minutes without severe pain. I couldn‚Äôt write, I couldn‚Äôt do hair, I couldn‚Äôt do anything. The school again was so amazing and still didn‚Äôt kick me out. Instead, I just sat down and worked in the office the rest of the time checking in clients and helping with inventory. My cosmetology friends and teachers were supportive. I didn‚Äôt have friends at high school. Doctors were still telling me I was crazy. 

The main cosmetology teacher had some health issues of her own and we really clicked. She went to this acupuncture lady that she thought I should go to and see if she could help me with my pain. I was desperate and would try anything. I went to this cute acupuncture lady and loved her. Acupuncture was amazing and we also tried cupping which felt good. But the problem was, the pain relief was temporary - like wouldn‚Äôt even last more than an hour. And insurance didn‚Äôt cover it. But the cute acupuncture lady is an important part of my story because she told me she thought I had MS. That wasn‚Äôt a diagnosis we had explored. 

We went to an MS doctor in our area and after meeting with me he instantly said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have MS and I can‚Äôt help you, but I know someone I‚Äôm pretty sure can.‚Äù So then we went and saw this other doctor. And this other doctor is to this day still my current PCP and has changed my life. He met with me and diagnosed me with something we had never heard of - POTS. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. He was able to teach me more about my body and symptoms that kept popping up more and more as time went on. He showed me my heart rate was over the roof high and explained the fatigue. He got me on meds, into PT, and helped me build up my strength. We still couldn‚Äôt figure out what the nerve pain was from, but a lot of my other issues had started to stabilize. 

About half way through my senior year of high school I started getting really sick in a new way. I couldn‚Äôt eat or drink anything without throwing it up and without terrible pain in my stomach. I would throw up randomly through out the day. We had no idea what was going on. I got sicker and sicker but still managed to graduate. How? My blessing of a mother. She did all my homework for me since I couldn‚Äôt write. I missed over 90 days of my senior year at high school. I am 5‚Äô11 and got down to 100 pounds. After graduating everyone I knew went off to college, got jobs, moved on. Meanwhile, I was stuck at home, couldn‚Äôt eat and was throwing up all the time. Everyone was telling me I had an eating disorder. I was so weak I couldn‚Äôt move on my own. My parents and siblings had to walk me to and from the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt go anywhere except from my bed to the couch and from the couch to my bed. Eventually, my PCP found out I had something very rare he hadn‚Äôt even really heard of or seen called MALS. Mediate Articulate Ligament Syndrome. At the time it was basically unheard of. No one in Utah did the surgery, I was going to have to go to California for it. The scans that diagnosed me showed that the artery in my stomach that helps digest food was 80% compressed. But when we went to CA and I actually had the open surgery, they told me when they got in, they saw something they‚Äôve never seen before. A muscle that anatomically shouldn‚Äôt have been there, had grown over my artery compressing it 100% allowing no blood flow. And my back up arteries were sagging and not allowing blood flow either so my stomach quite literally couldn‚Äôt digest anything I ate or drank. The surgery itself was a success, but I was in SO much surgical pain. From my years of nerve pain and trying different pain meds for relief, we figured out no typical pain meds or opiates worked for me. After this MALS surgery, I told the hospital that but they didn‚Äôt believe me so they gave me oxy and other pain meds. Just like I had told them, it wasn‚Äôt working. They continued to pump me full of meds and tried fentanyl instead. Towards the end of the day I was still in extreme pain and had been crying all day. I told the hospital that I couldn‚Äôt breathe and they ignored me and said I couldn‚Äôt breathe because I had been crying all day and to just go to bed. The hospital didn‚Äôt have me on oxygen or a heart rate/oxygen monitor or anything. Which now we know is illegal. I told my mom to promise to hold my hand and don‚Äôt let go even when I fall asleep. My guardian angel mother promised and it‚Äôs a good thing she did. I fell asleep, and my mom fell asleep in a chair next to the bed still holding my hand. She woke up with a startle when she felt me seizing. She turned on the lights and I was completely blue and had stopped breathing. The hospital had ODed me. They‚Äôd given me way too many pain meds for my tiny malnourished body. If my mom hadn‚Äôt been holding my hand and felt me seize, I‚Äôd be dead because they weren‚Äôt monitoring me in anyway. All I remember is falling asleep and then waking up and shooting straight up vomiting my guts out. It was as if I was wearing orange tinted glasses. Everything was orange and there were 10+ nurses screaming at me and ripping my vomit soaked gown off and yelling at me that it was my fault. That I took too many meds. Which is funny because it‚Äôs literally impossible to OD yourself with a pain pump the hospital is in charge of. I don‚Äôt remember much after that besides having extreme PTSD and being very angry and upset by the situation. Typing this out makes me sick to my stomach. The whole thing was just so upsetting. Even to this day, every time I throw up, I cry and have mild panic attacks. 

After a full day of no pain meds even though I just had open stomach surgery, they finally sent a pain management doctor to us and eventually we figured out the only medication that actually helps my pain so at least from that point on, we‚Äôve known what to ask for after surgeries. 

We went home back to Utah and the surgery was a success but I was still dealing with the PTSD and anger. I ate anything and everything I could. Eating was a dream. I gained over 30 pounds in a month. I started getting my strength back. I still had my leg and arm pain, but I could eat, which was amazing. 

Who knows how long later, I started getting debilitating migraines. The lights had to be off all the time, everyone had to be super quiet, I‚Äôd even have to plug my ears when people got ice from the fridge because it was too loud. 
After lots of testing and other symptoms coming up, we figured out I had a hole in my dura and was leaking spinal fluid which is called a CSF leak. This is fixed by a blood patch. They take blood out of your arm and inject it back into your dura to plug the hole. Well, just my luck, the guy got too close to my spine and ended up causing me to be bed ridden for over a year. I‚Äôm not saying bed ridden as in, I can‚Äôt really walk. I‚Äôm saying bed ridden as in I couldn‚Äôt even sit up without being in excruciating pain. Sitting up to even go to the bathroom had me crying in pain. Every. Single. Time. I went to the bathroom. For a year. I had to be laying down completely flat. My parents literally moved a bed into the living room so I could be with the family and watch tv during the day. All I could do was watch tv because my arms didn‚Äôt work without pain either. 

About a year later we finally found my miracle medication that helped my back nerve pain so I could sit up and live again. Being able to function is what led me to meeting my now husband. I‚Äôll share our whole crazy love story another time. 

I was still having the bad migraines and we still couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on with my arms and legs and why I had the nerve pain there. Eventually we figured out I had Chiari Malformation which meant my brain was sagging into my spine. We thought this was what was causing the nerve pain and the migraines. The theory still to this day is that when I hit my head and broke my foot the first time all those years ago, it triggered all these issues, my POTS, and basically knocked my brain loose. 

No one in Utah did the surgery and it was still pretty uncommon, at least in the chronic illness world at the time. I ended up going to New York for the surgery and one of the top neuro surgeons in the country was the one to do it. This surgery is invasive, so before actually doing the surgery - they do a test surgery to see if it‚Äôll work. For the test surgery, they put 2 bolts into the side/temple of my head, 1 on each side, and then they lifted my skull off my spine and woke me up to see if I was still in pain. Being woken up in the middle of a surgery is wild, just have to throw that out there. So I tried using my arms and writing and doing other little tasks and had no arm pain - we were all excited. They put me back to sleep and finished up. 

I don‚Äôt remember almost anything after that. If you can‚Äôt tell by now, I trauma block. Hours after the surgery and hours after I was supposed to have woken up, I still hadn‚Äôt woke up. I was becoming hypothermic and they knew something was wrong. Turns out, they had nicked an artery that anatomically shouldn‚Äôt have been there (note another pattern) pulling out one of the bolts and I had been bleeding into my brain. They rushed me into a 10 hour emergency craniotomy and cracked open half my skull. After the surgery, the surgeon had told my parents that the odds of me waking up were very slim, and if I did wake up, I wouldn‚Äôt be lucid and potentially brain dead. Obviously everyone was beyond devastated. I was the 2nd ‚Äúmistake‚Äù in this surgeons entire career. I do want to say, that I do not blame this surgeon. It was not his fault my body is anatomically different. 

I was in a coma for 5 days. Even when I woke up, I wasn‚Äôt lucid. I wasn‚Äôt talking, couldn‚Äôt eat on my own and my motor skills were very off, my eyes were open, but I wasn‚Äôt really there. I don‚Äôt remember any of this. I had to relearn how to do a lot of things and eventually became more lucid. It‚Äôs an absolute miracle I am mostly the same. I do have brain damage from the traumatic brain injury that will continue to affect my life, but it could‚Äôve been so much worse. Due to where the brain bleed was, I have some anger issues that were really bad at first. I would black out and have fits of anger that I have no memory of. Now my anger is more under control but it‚Äôs still a constant battle. I swear more than I‚Äôd like to. I used to never swear and now I have to consciously stop myself from swearing. I have memory issues - long term and short term. I‚Äôm dumber than I used to be - I have a hard time coming up with words sometimes and in general just struggle with basic academic things. But overall, at least I am still mostly me. 

Obviously they weren‚Äôt able to do the Chiari Malformation surgery at the time so I had to go back home and recover from the craniotomy for 3 months. Once I was physically recovered from that, I shaved my head because I was basically bald anyways from the craniotomy and they‚Äôd be shaving the back for the fusion. Then we went back to New York and I had the spinal fusion. I now only have half the motion looking left and right as well as up and down. The surgery was successful for the most part. It fixed my migraines and some other symptoms which was a huge blessing, but it didn‚Äôt fix my arm and leg pain. 

We kept looking for reasons and diagnosis to figure out what was causing my arm and leg pain. We found out that I had May Thurners and Nutcracker. Which basically means the iliac artery going to my legs was compressed so my legs had limited blood flow, therefore, causing pain. We did a stent to treat the May Thurners and that didn‚Äôt do anything and they now know there‚Äôs no point in doing that. Next I got an auto kidney transplant which is cool because I basically had a kidney transplant and was my own donor. My left kidney was compressing the iliac artery so they moved my left kidney to my right side - I now have 2 kidneys on my right side. I was also one of the first in my area to get this. Now, 5 years later, they‚Äôve progressed enough to be able to do the surgery and move the left kidney up, instead of over to the right. The surgery for Nutcracker was a success. It helped me go from not being able to stand or walk for more than a couple of minutes AND having to wear compression stockings all the time (unless I was sleeping), to being able to walk and stand for an hour + at a time. There was one complication, but it wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault. This was my first time being intubated since my fusion, so when they pulled out the intubation, my jaw automatically reflexed and bit down on the tube. This caused a pulmonary edema and all the fluid went into my lungs basically meaning I drowned myself. This caused an extra day or 2 stay in the hospital. 

I do still have leg pain and cannot walk or stand as long as a normal healthy person, but I‚Äôve improved significantly since that surgery. I have bad days where even standing to load the dishwasher gets really painful. But far more good days than bad. 

Next, we figured out more of what was going on with my arms. I have TOS - Thoracic Outlet Syndrome which is a compression of the artery allowing blood flow to your arms. This makes my arms hurt when I use them. Noticing another pattern? Lots of compressions. I got the surgery for the right arm and they removed a rib, muscle, and tendon. I kept the rib because why not? This surgery was also overall a success. I do still have arm pain when I use my arms too long, but I‚Äôm able to actually use them. I can write and type and do things for longer periods of time. I didn‚Äôt do the surgery on my left arm since it‚Äôs not my dominant side and the surgery itself was pretty painful and a long recovery. I didn‚Äôt want to go through it again for a non dominant arm/hand. 

After all this, I was comfortable. Happy and content with where I was at in life. I had a job, I got married, moved out. Things were great and better than I would‚Äôve imagined for myself during my sickest times. I had sworn off surgeries. Said I‚Äôm only getting more surgeries if it‚Äôs completely necessary and will 100% fix what it needs to. 

Then - I had really bad uterus/ovary pain. I‚Äôve had ovarian cysts before and they‚Äôve even ruptured (excruciating). This time though, the cyst was the size of a softball. It wouldn‚Äôt have dissolved on its own so I had to get it surgically removed. During that surgery, they found that I had really bad endometriosis and they scraped it all out for me. They had told me if I had tried to have a baby, we never would‚Äôve gotten pregnant because of the endo. This diagnosis wasn‚Äôt a surprise to any of us. My periods have been terrible ever since they started. I would frequently miss days of school because I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed and was curled up in a ball because the cramps were so bad. 

Healing from that was fine. No issues. Later, my husband and I decided we were ready to start our own family. I was the healthiest I‚Äôd been since I first got sick. We were expecting to have fertility issues due to all my other health issues. Surprisingly enough, we got pregnant the very first month we started trying. It didn‚Äôt seem real. We were beyond ecstatic. My dream of being a mother was finally going to come true. We scheduled our first ultrasound for when I was 12 weeks. We showed up to the ultrasound so excited to see our little babe and hear their heart beat. The moment they started the ultrasound, the doctors face immediately dropped. I knew something was wrong. She told us the baby had no heart beat. I felt sick. I‚Äôd never felt a pain like that before. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I didn‚Äôt think my life could get any worse - until it did. Because my body didn‚Äôt naturally miscarry the baby, I had to get a D&C where they surgically removed the baby. I didn‚Äôt get out of bed for over a week. I would never wish the pain of someone losing a baby on anyone. It was unbearable. 

Later we decided to start trying for a baby again. At this time I also started having crazy gallbladder issues. At the ER, they told me I had gallstones and was pregnant but having another miscarriage. Learning you‚Äôre pregnant and having a miscarriage at the same time is a feeling I can‚Äôt describe. 

After mourning that 2nd loss, we started trying for a baby again. Total, I went to the ER 3x before they finally agreed to take my gallbladder out because each time we went, the gallstones were getting bigger. At this time we found out I was pregnant and the baby had a heart beat. We were so happy but of course so nervous, especially knowing I needed to get my gallbladder out. I had so many mixed feelings but hope outshone them all - my baby had a heart beat! The doctors had said the gallbladder surgery was very low risk for the baby and I needed to get it out, so we went through with the surgery. I got my gallbladder out and our miracle baby survived it. 

I was very cautious the whole pregnancy and took care of myself the best I ever had. Due to being high risk, I had more appointments that a normal pregnancy would. At 33 weeks pregnant, my husband and I moved to be closer to his work. At my 34 week check up, they were concerned about my blood pressure and sent me to the hospital. My blood pressure was 184/90. They had said it could be a false alarm but to go to the hospital just in case. When I got to the hospital they had confirmed my blood pressure was crazy high and called my OB. My OB got to the hospital and told me I had preeclampsia and that we needed to deliver the baby asap. If we didn‚Äôt deliver the baby I could have a stroke and both the baby and I could die. I called my husband and said ‚Äúhi surprise pack a bag and come to the hospital, we‚Äôre having the baby‚Äù. He was shocked and came as fast as possible. Our house wasn‚Äôt even close to being unpacked and things were a mess. Now we were having our baby? 

They started to induce me over night and in the morning broke my water. I 1 million percent wanted the epidural. When the anesthesiologist administered the epidural, only half of my body went kind of numb but I could still feel a lot. I was in so much pain and so so sick. The further my labor progressed, the worst my pain and sickness got and eventually I could feel everything - the epidural wasn‚Äôt working. They gave me another one, and that didn‚Äôt work either. The labor was awful but everything was worth it when I got to see my sweet baby girl. She was so tiny and so beautiful. They instantly had to take her and hook her up to all the machines and monitors, but I was able to hold her for a minute or two before they whisked her away to the NICU. My husband went with the baby and kept me updated on our beautiful girl. We were so so so lucky and blessed she didn‚Äôt have any issues. Her lungs and everything else were developed fully, she could breathe on her own, she wasn‚Äôt jaundice. However, due to being only 34 weeks, she hadn‚Äôt developed the suck function and was so sleepy. She slept basically 24/7 for a month. She was in the NICU for 44 days. It was so incredibly painful having to leave your baby. I cried every single time for weeks. But I at least knew she was in good hands and being taken care of. After 44 days we got to take our miracle girl home. 

Now, she‚Äôs 18 months and thriving. She‚Äôs so smart, funny, sassy, and has so much personality. I‚Äôm so grateful to be her mama and looking back at everything I‚Äôve been through, knowing it leads to this, it‚Äôs all worth it. 

Keeping up with an active adrenaline junkie baby has had its own challenges. My body is still fighting pain and fatigue every day. The lack of sleep makes things worse. It‚Äôs hard to hold her the bigger she gets. I still have a lot of bad days, but thankfully I‚Äôve felt good enough to keep up with her the best I can. I‚Äôm even trying to start my own business with the first product being medical ID bracelets. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been super excited about, even though Ive been trying, I haven‚Äôt sold any yet. It‚Äôs been difficult trying to keep up with being a mom, having a decently clean home, my health, and doing things needed to start a business. 

My next goal is to be healthy enough and in a good enough mental state to start trying for another baby this year. 

I hope sharing my story has helped people feel less alone, provided some hope, and brought more awareness to the difficulties of being chronically ill.

My doctors are dropped from my plan constantly, no one knows who‚Äôs in network so I NEED an appointment, it‚Äôs been a CONSTANT cycle of appointments to get any one specialist visit taken care of and the cancer usually takes priority. 

So anyway, symptoms I guess, I‚Äôm curious if any of you have experienced this and had it been like plain old IBD. I have no obstructions or anything so I feel like it‚Äôs likely 

- I am usually super underweight/low appetite but they think that‚Äôs because
- I have some level of like‚Ä¶ slow metabolism? Slow digestion? Basically it takes too long for some things to get through my stomach?
- I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gone a full week without some level of diarrhea in my adult life 
- often with a LOT of mucus. Sometimes like ALL some kind of mucus 
- or an alarming amount of bleeding (but it‚Äôs been a few months!)
- my stomach/intestines cramp up severely which somehow usually ends up kind of traveling to my legs
- when I have a flare up I sometimes get weird skin issues, like one time my whole face and neck broke out in weird semi-hives (not red and itchy, just like weird bumps) which she attributed to Crohn‚Äôs but idk
- obviously low levels of certain things including magnesium but‚Ä¶ diarrhea will do that
- again during these flare ups only I tend to get really weird, all day nausea. It almost felt like when I had morning sickness. It‚Äôs been a lot better recently (as in I‚Äôm just super nauseated, not actually puking this time)

Has anyone had these symptoms (obviously it‚Äôs not comprehensive) and had it not be Crohn‚Äôs?? I don‚Äôt want to start this whole whacky journey right now if it‚Äôs probably something they can‚Äôt even treat anyway so I am just trying to figure it out. Wouldn‚Äôt I have had some kind of bowel issue necessitating medical care if I was dealing with Crohn‚Äôs for this long (easily over 10 years) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1lwp18w/how_can_you_tell_if_you_have_crohns_or_just_ibs/,1752183504.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Anyone else like that? Basically everything I put in me that isn‚Äòt super restricted/ bland/very low fibre/fat I get either reflux or diarrhea over.

My nutritionist thinks that my shrinking list of safe foods is due to my own restrictions combined with me not being able to treat this for years (so my intestines are basically at least low-key inflamed all the time).

I have a long history of chronic constipation and hemorrhoids along with ibs and food intolerance.

The caveat is my mom and brother do have crohn‚Äôs.

1m86w9p,IBD,Crohns/ Ulcerative colitis HELP,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm feeling really overwhelmed and hoping to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar.
Back in March, I had some constipation and bloating. My GP gave me laxatives and everything resolved quickly. Fast forward to early July I had one bowel movement with mucus and visible blood. Mucus remained for a few days after but only once had there been blood in bowl.
I saw whichever GP was available that day, and they prescribed laxatives. I pushed for a colonoscopy, which was booked the following week.
Colonoscopy findings:
-Mayo 1/ mild ulcerative colitis
-25 cm of continuous inflammation starting from the rectum
-One isolated per-appendiceal patch
-No granulomas
-Normal small bowel
I waited a month unmedicated for biopsy results. Today, the gastroenterologist reviewed it and diagnosed Crohn‚Äôs disease even though the report says mild UC. She prescribed prednisolone 50mg starting immediately with a taper (about 9 weeks total), and said I‚Äôll need immunosuppressants and biologics next.
She didn‚Äôt mention mesalazine (Pentasa) at all, nor did she explain clearly why she believes it‚Äôs Crohn‚Äôs instead of UC, especially when the colonoscopy didn‚Äôt show clear Crohn‚Äôs markers (skip lesions, granulomas, small bowel disease).
Oddly enough Tonight (a few hours after my appointment strangely at 7:38pm even though the clinic closes at 4pm), she called to say 50mg was too high, and I should actually start at 40mg instead. I had already questioned the dose earlier in the day.

My questions:
Is it normal to skip mesalazine and jump straight to steroids/ followed by immunosuppressants for mild inflammation?
Why the urgency to label this as Crohn‚Äôs so quickly?
What difference would 10mg of prednisolone really make in mild disease?
Should I be getting a second opinion before committing to such an aggressive treatment path?

If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have advice, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what‚Äôs actually best for my body.

I‚Äôm hoping to hear from others who‚Äôve had similar experiences because I‚Äôm feeling really dismissed by my OBGYN right now.

I had a Kyleena IUD placed last Friday, and about an hour after the insertion, I started having nausea that has not gone away. I also started experiencing heightened anxiety that feels exactly like what I get with my period, just dialed way up. I wasn‚Äôt on any birth control before this (and I wasn‚Äôt nervous about getting the IUD), so these changes feel really sudden and connected to the insertion.

My doctor told me there‚Äôs ‚Äúno way‚Äù the IUD could be causing this, and I honestly feel gaslit. But something feels off.

Here‚Äôs some relevant health background:

* I‚Äôm 32
* I have IBD
* I‚Äôve had a colon resection
* I also have ankylosing spondylitis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
* I deal with severe constipation
* My periods were normal before the IUD

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my colon could be pressing on my uterus, or if something about the IUD has thrown off the balance between my gut and hormones. Either way, the nausea and anxiety are really interfering with my day-to-day life.

Has anyone with IBD or other GI issues had a similar reaction to Kyleena or any hormonal IUD? Did things calm down after a while, or did you end up having it removed?

1kqzrla,IBD,Rant and health anxiety,"So the past year and a half I‚Äôve had a wide range of symptoms that I initially waved off as a ‚Äústomach bug‚Äù or stress: 
Then when it didn‚Äôt go away I started trying to get medical help and I got rejected a lot. I was told it was stress, anxiety, IBS etc. 
I‚Äôve had chronic diarrhea (literally daily), bloody stools/rectal bleeding, nausea, joint pains, reoccurring fever, mouth ulcers, weight loss, fatigue/feeling faint, headaches, stomach and abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weak immune system, random rashes, fainting spells etc constantly for over a year. 
No doctor took me seriously for months. I finally ended up with a doctor who surprisingly enough asked me what I thought could be wrong with me. I told him I‚Äôd read about IBD and that I was curious why no one had tried doing a calprotectin test on me to see if there was inflammation. He agreed that it was indeed odd and ran my calprotecting, ruled out all forms of bacterial/parasite infections, ruled out celiac diseases and possible allergies/intolerances. I‚Äôve also ruled out any reproductive issues such as endometriosis etc, so that‚Äôs off the table. 

The only one that came back positive/elevated was my calprotectin that was way over where it should‚Äôve been. He also did blood tests where my crp was elevated as well as SR and I had low albumin and I was also anemic. 
He said this def in combination with my symptoms speak of possible IBD. He sent me to a GI specialist, and I ended up going through a colonoscopy, and endoscopy and an ultra sound. 
On the ultra sound they saw mild swelling in some places and the colonoscopy found about 10cm of inflammation in my descendant, ulcers in my duodenum and an anal fissure/fistule. 

I‚Äôve been absolutely nerve wrecked the last couple of weeks about the biopsy results, and I was supposed to have had a follow up appointments today with my doc (however she cancelled last minute which kinda send me spiraling) and moved it to Thursday. My mom (I‚Äôm a minor) called the hospital and asked if they could at least tell us what they think is going on, and the nurse/receptionist said that from her understanding of the things she read about the file she doesn‚Äôt see clear indicators of IBD. 

This genuinely kind of broke me apart. I was so sure (my GI doctor told me she was almost convinced it was IBD and that she had no idea what else it could possibly be) that I was close to finding an answer and therefore treatment and now I feel like my hope was crushed. 

I need help I can‚Äôt live like this, I haven‚Äôt gone to school for basically a year because I‚Äôve been forced to do it all from home, I can‚Äôt meet my friends, hell I‚Äôve lost half of them because I can‚Äôt go out, I feel guilty for being so difficult for my bf and for being a liability to my family and I literally am not living, I‚Äôm inside all day just studying, I can‚Äôt even go on walks half the time.

I know a receptionist obviously isn‚Äôt qualified to judge test results and I know I need to wait until Thursday for my doctor to explain it to me. I just want to ask, is it possible it‚Äôs still IBD but like ‚Äúearly stages‚Äù so that it won‚Äôt be obvious in the biopsies yet? Like could they‚Äôve missed it? 

Might be worth mentioning too, once I had the colonoscopy/endoscopy is started getting a little better (I stopped eating as much and did primarily a liquid diet for a good while) and my inflammation went down a bit, so I felt better than I have previously while the tests were run. Idk if that impacts. 

Anyways, obviously I don‚Äôt WANT IBD, it sounds horrible and it‚Äôs chronic, what I DO want is clarity. And answer to why I‚Äôm sick all the time, because it‚Äôs not just my stomach. 
Yes that is a huge part of it, but my immune system just randomly 1,5 years ago went downhill completely, I get sick every to every second week (no joke, fever, cough, snotty, sneezing, lethargic, etc) like properly, my joints hurt basically daily, I am paler than a ghost (I used to have like a naturally pretty tan complexion and now I genuinely look like a pasty white wall) I have chronic purple eye bags, I smell sick (my mom tells me ongoingly that I smell like a sick person), I have random rashes appearing on and off etc. so it‚Äôs not just digestive issues.

1kd6ll6,IBD,Need Advice or a least read similar stories to lower anxiety - Ongoing Foot Inflammation (Gout? IBD Arthritis? something else ?),"Hey everyone,



I‚Äôm a 35-year-old guy with Crohn‚Äôs disease (diagnosed 12 years ago, had a 60 cm bowel resection). I take daily cholestyramine, but no other meds long-term. No family history of Crohn‚Äôs, arthritis, or gout.



For the past couple of years, my crohn has been calm and without symptoms, but I‚Äôve been getting lately weird, painful flare-ups in my feet ‚Äî mostly the right foot at first, but now also the left. It‚Äôs been hard to figure out what‚Äôs really going on, so I‚Äôm hoping someone here might relate.



Here‚Äôs a quick summary:



Summer 2022: First big flare ‚Äî my whole right foot swelled up, especially the big toe area. It happened after a long day of sports and likely dehydration. Thought it might be gout.

Late summer 2024: Hurt my right Achilles during sports. Next day I couldn‚Äôt walk. Was diagnosed with microtears. Later, stretching exercises triggered inflammation under the big toe (felt more mechanical than gouty).

Fall 2024 ‚Äì Early 2025: A few more flares in the same spot (right foot, under the big toe). Pain comes on gradually over 1‚Äì2 days, not suddenly. Naproxen helped, but messed up my stomach, and my calprotectin came back high, so I switched meds.

Late April 2025: Another flare started in the right foot, then moved to the left foot, this time at the back of the heel/Achilles insertion. No injury, no sport, no trigger. Just pain and stiffness that made it hard to walk.

I‚Äôve had one slightly high uric acid result, but others were normal. A podiatrist thought it was gout. My GI nurse said Crohn's and gout aren't really connected. Now I‚Äôm wondering if it could be IBD-related arthritis. Still haven‚Äôt seen a rheumatologist yet, but in the process of‚Ä¶



I'm now trying celecoxib, which helps and seems easier on the gut than naproxen. But I‚Äôm kind of at a loss. These flares hit hard, and they‚Äôre messing with my quality of life ‚Äî I‚Äôve even had to stop practicing sport (ball hockey on foot), can be hard on joints, but which I love. Sometimes the flares happen a day or two after playing‚Ä¶ It could be related..



Main symptoms:



Foot pain that builds up gradually (not sudden)

Pain mostly under the big toe (sesamoid) or at the back of the heel

Sometimes mild swelling/stiffness, no obvious redness

Naproxen helps, but messes with digestion

No other joints affected, no back pain



If anyone has dealt with something like this ‚Äî especially Crohn‚Äôs folks or people with gout/arthritis ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from you. Just trying to make sense of it all and push for the right kind of care.

My doctor ordered me to do some stool test which came out negative for c.diff, salmonella, and other bacterial infections like shigella. My calprotectin level were as high as 595 which is abnormal. This has freaked me out and my doctor has told me eat a cutrelle pill every day for the next two weeks and if it still consists I will have to go to a GI doctor to see if I have ibd. My blood test I took a couple of weeks ago claimed my vitamin D is super low and I was prescribed medicine for it. Although my vitamin D has been low in past blood tests because I have melanated skin.

1jqvgfl,IBD,Panic attacks and out of ideas,I have been disabled for awhile now.  Back injury leads me to pain medication surgeries and turning into a headache.  Few years ago I developed stomach issues notably chronic constipation the doctors believe the opioid is the cause.  Prior to the issues I was on a much higher dosage of opioid medication with very minor constipation from time to time nothing a over the counter stool softener from time to time would clear up right away.  I believe I may just have a nerve issue but because I have a fusion they say no nerve is being impinged. I have been told I may have ibs ibd or chrons. I have tried so many medication and miralax had been working for awhile but I was given linzess to try.  At first it was to much on my stomach tried different days but now I'm on it daily still backed up and now I'm getting panic attacks daily bad enough to ruin my life.  I previously had a bad bout of a panic attack that was from constipation gas building up being trapped all day had pain in upper back which I mistakenly thought ended up being in my upper stomach making me think it was a back pain. As soon as I cleared out my system no more panic attacks. That was 2 years ago.  Now I'm having them daily doctor dismissed my concerns.

1k8fs0y,IBD,Need advice. Crohns or MC... What should I do next,"Hi everyone! First of all sorry for my English. I just want to share my story with you and ask for your opinions, advices, prayers.
I'm 37yo male and from last August I started having some pain in my LLQ, I saw a GI, blood tests were okay, no celiac disease, tested positive for lactose intolerance, calprotectine of 119, negative FIT (ocult blood), normal abdominal echography, pain, normal BM, lack of appetite. My GI told me it s IBS and dismissed me.

Moving fwd 2 months, LLQ pain got worse, a few episodes of nocturnal cramps and loose stools, and bam, all of a sudden intense pain/ burning in my stomach ( epigastric area) which started at night, in the morning 3-4 am, complete lack of appetite, I couldn't eat much.

Had colonoscopy and endoscopy.

Biopsies:

Endoscopy - chronic gastroduodenitis with H pylori and sessile polyps under 10 mm. 

Colonoscopy - microscopic collagenous colitis, no ulcers, chronic ileitis (no ulcers)

I lost 5 kg from 55 to 50 in 5 months.

Had triple therapy for h pylori with amoxiciline, levofloxacine and Esomeprazole.

Repeated calprotectin - came back 547!!

They said it's not Chrons, gave me budesonide 9 mg and pentasa ( mesalamine) 3 g daily - after 8 weeks calprotectine came back 29 but I had pretty much the same initial symptoms...

Had a CT enterography with oral contrast and enema, but without iv contrast (had a panic attack) - came back unremarkable - just a dolicolon, no thickening of the bowel.

Had an MR enterography 3 Tesla, without iv contrast (again panicky attack) came back normal for the small and large bowel - just thickened gastric mucosa...

They told me to tapper budesonide after 2 months from 9 to 6 mg - 3 wks, which I did, then bam, symptoms came back strong - nocturnal cramps and loose stool, pain, nausea, feeling of having to poop but nothing comes out, mucus, extreme fatigue, lack of sleep, shivers...

Now I don't know what to do, because I kept complaining when I was tapering that I don't feel OK, to 2 GIs, both dismissed me because of my normal calpro, saying it's more like IBS, not IBD.... Was sent to psychiatrist, was told I was overreacting...

Do you guys think it might be Chrons? Or just MC?

GI refuses to do a pill cam because of no bleeding.

Don't know what to do anymore. I'm in constant pain, can't eat well, can't sleep well, I am very anxious because I live alone, have no family, need to be able to work, to pay for my flat... Went to the ER a couple of times, was dismissed because blood work was always normal. Iron, feritine, hemoglobin, CRP, all normal. Also no worms, infections...

Do you have any advice please, I beg you?

Also how accurate could be an MR enterography without iv contrast?

I'm only reading bland - soup, grilled chicken breast, rice, mashed potatoes, bananas, tea...

1lg6vhm,IBD,Best ways for support,"My message goes out to parents, family members, friends of people having to deal with IBD/UC.
My son was diagnosed with ulcerative hemorrhagic rectocolitis about 7 years ago but, as a parent and by doing the math, I think this started much earlier. He is 28 now.
He has seen 3 physicians over the years, done the full spectre of imagistics and blood tests, and he has followed the treatments. However things do not seem to be progressing well.
I'm wondering what I could do to support him even more, since one issue few people are talking about when it comes to IBD/UC diseases is the stress, the frustration people go through. And I see that eating away at my son, he is keeping more to himself, not socializing, and I get it why.
If you fall in my category and you have been through this, I would appreciate any ideas, tips, pointers of things that I could do besides being close and supportive.

Hello, I don't know if this is allowed or not but am at my wit's end. I'm a 20F who has been suffering from some sort of stomach/bowel issue for the last 3 weeks and don't know what to do. 

I just need answers or some sort of an explanation and I'm hoping someone here can help me. In the middle of May, I had a bowel movemernt one morning that kind of scared me (I should mention that I do have pretty bad health anxiety and had a bad related panic attack in the beginning of this year).

It was a lot of dark with a little bit of light pieces, and it felt pretty urgent. The moment I saw the coloring immediately thought I was bleeding internally and started worrying (yes, I know), but stopped myself pretty quickly. 

From that day, I've been feeling a lot of pain/heaviness in the left side of my abdomen, in the upper area all the way down to my hip, sort of feels like it's my back/inside my body, not the front. saw a GI doctor who made me take a stool test and nothing came from that. He did do an ultrasound and said that he could barely see anything because was so gassy. Now he's prescribed me antibiotics and am just worried about taking them because I don't know if it will mess up my system even more.


 Some history. I am autistic, have pretty bad anxiety, and do have exams coming up. Last year, in January, I had haemorrhoids for the first time (internal) and got tested for Crohn's, celiac, etc, and nothing came back. Now just feel horrible and know that it can be stress-induced but that worries me because it feels like a blanket explanation that ignores a serious issue. 

I dont know if it's my spleen, or my kidney (I don't think so) or my colon (more plausible), but am tired. I am done. Please, if you've felt anything like this, let me know. Thank you:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1l696lq/helpguidance/,1749379199.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1hwrzih,IBD,Severe abdominal pain and depression ,"
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old male, and for the past two months, I‚Äôve been struggling with persistent stomach/abdominal pain as well as pain in my chest area. The pain feels like a burning and nervous sensation, and it‚Äôs at its worst in the mornings. Sometimes it wakes me up in the middle of the night.

In terms of other symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve noticed fresh blood in my stool, along with mucus.
	‚Ä¢	My stool often smells unusually bad.
	‚Ä¢	I used to have acid reflux, but after taking PPIs for three weeks, that has subsided and hasn‚Äôt returned.

On the mental side, this has taken a huge toll on me. I‚Äôve been experiencing severe depression, crying every single day because I‚Äôm in constant pain and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I‚Äôm starting to lose hope.

So far, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve gone through in terms of tests:
	‚Ä¢	Endoscopy and colonoscopy: Both came back normal.
	‚Ä¢	Ultrasound of my abdomen: Nothing abnormal.
	‚Ä¢	Stool tests for parasites: All came back negative.
	‚Ä¢	H. pylori: Negative.
	‚Ä¢	Celiac disease: Negative.

The only findings so far:
	‚Ä¢	My fecal calprotectin level is 571 (elevated).
	‚Ä¢	I also have iron deficiency.

I‚Äôm scheduled for a capsule endoscopy soon, but in the meantime, I feel lost.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? I feel like the mental symptoms‚Äîdepression, hopelessness‚Äîare becoming even worse than the physical pain. Any advice or shared experiences would mean the world to me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

11885bq,IBD,"Sudden Realisation about Depression, Fatigue - 20 years wasted.","I've been behind a computer for most of my working life, I feel like I've always had frequent bouts of extreme fatigue / brain fog particularly in the afternoon, I've always put it down to boredom and lack of motivation, I just saw it as a manifestation of my procrastination.

I remember having a colonoscopy in my early 20s, a horrible experience - they didn't find cancer and I lost direction with what to do next. I must have had issues throughout my 20s as in my 30s I had another colonscopy and got a diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis. I was prescribed mesalazine, I did not know they were 'for life' I took them for a bit when I thought I had a flare up, but I lost the ability to recognise a flare up and when it ""didn't seem so bad"" I accepted my condition as something I'd have to put up with.

I'm now 40, and in the last few years symptoms severely worsened. I found the left over meds from before and started taking them, I saw a doctor and got a repeat prescription as well as a referral to gastrology which took 6 months before I could speak to anyone. In that time I have taken Mesalazine every day, and now they have now doubled my meds and prescribed me others I'm still waiting for the prescriptions for.

It's only right now, whilst feeling extremely fatigued having done nothing today, 20 years on that I'm considering maybe the fatigue, depression and low self-esteem I've carried with me for at least all my adult life, could be due to largely untreated UC. It can surely be debilitating sometimes, but I only just read today that UC flare ups can fatigue the body/cause brain fog, and well it's starting to make sense.. maybe I've just been living with constant flare ups for 20 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/11885bq/sudden_realisation_about_depression_fatigue_20/,1676996313.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1dg597o,IBD,Sedation Free Colonoscopy?! Yup. ,"Hey there everyone, I‚Äôm a 32 year old firefighter paramedic with Crohn‚Äôs. A little back story, when I first became symptomatic it came out of nowhere, bathroom problems and dramatic weight loss, and Crohn‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt even on my radar as a possibility. In and out of the hospital getting IV antibiotics and steroids about 4 times before getting a GI that would see me in his office. He wanted to schedule a colonoscopy and I wanted to stay awake to talk to him in real time in case he found something: here‚Äôs how that went for me. 

Prep day: I go cruising up to my local pharmacy expecting a little bottle of some powder to mix with water to shoot down and call it good, I was immediately filled with fear and trepidation as the poor pharmacy man was fighting for his life shoving a gallon bottle of prep mix through the drive thru cubby hole. I get to the house and start mixing my new favorite drink, and wiping the tears from my eyes I take the first sip. I decided I was going to be cool and just take the whole dose at once, imagine my surprise when 3 hours post cocktail there was no bathroom activity to be had. No worries though, it came eventually about 5 hours later. Pro tip: baby wipes are a game changer when it comes to colonoscopy prep, you and your orifices will thank the baby wipe companies for that. Once I felt I was thoroughly cleaned out, I decided to ditch the idea of strapping on a depends and head to bed. Being as this was my very first invasive procedure, sleep was a little elusive that night. 

Procedure time!!: I recruited a driver to bring me over to the hospital at an awful hour of the morning, nerves were about to take me out long before the Crohn‚Äôs got the chance. We arrive at the hospital and I go to the check in desk, pretty standard stuff. The registration lady calls me to her cubicle, and proceeds to ask about billing and all of that fun stuff. When it came time to break down the list of things that I was about to pay for, anesthesia was on the list. I wish I could‚Äôve taken a picture of this lady‚Äòs face when I told her that I was going to be doing this colonoscopy sans anesthesia, because I assure you it would be framed above my fireplace right now. Once the papers were signed and I was ready to roll. She wished me the best of luck and sent me to the waiting room. A short time later, a nurse comes out of the doors that lead to the back of the building and called, and off I go on this interesting little adventure. The nurses in the room were super nice, they told me to take off all of my clothes and put this hospital gown on open to the back. Thoroughly undressed and thoroughly freaked out, the questions begin to come in. Are you allergic to anything? Do you have any medical history? Have you had any surgeries? With most of those answers being no, she began to prep an IV, as nobody had told her that I was going with no anesthesia. I politely informed her that that wouldn‚Äôt be necessary because I was taking this on wide awake, and she just sort of looked at me like I had stolen her first born child. It was just about that time. The anesthesiologist came in the room to talk to me as they do prior to any kind of procedure that they would be dealing with you for. I also informed him that I would not be needing his services today that I was taking this on without the assistance of any of his fun juice. He was very understanding and he told me that if I changed my mind during the procedure that he would be there to just let my doctor know and I would be off to sleep before I knew what was going on. Finally I rolled back to the procedure room, staring at all the monitors and hoses and wires that were about to be invading my personal space, along with the most pleasant new grad nurse that was trying to hold small talk with me to keep me distracted. My G.I. doctor comes into the room and asked if I‚Äôm ready to get started ( I really had to think about the answer), but nonetheless I told him I was ready to rock. The part nobody prepared me for was the digital exam prior to the actual colonoscopy, it was hands-down, the worst part of the entire thing, and even then it was only marginally uncomfortable. When the colonoscopy itself began, I barely felt any kind of insertion and there was zero pain whatsoever. You quickly adjust to the feeling of being mildly uncomfortably propped open, and it was very, very smooth sailing from there. Before I knew he had reached the cecum, and since I was tolerating the procedure excellently he took a peek at my terminal ileum and started making sounds that were along the lines of ‚ÄúAhhh, hmmmm, I see‚Äù, and it was at that moment I was convinced I was done for. In my brain, I had some sort of acute pathology that was about to turn me into a memory. He then informed me that it was textbook, Crohn‚Äôs disease. Believe it or not, I was very relieved that it was Crohn‚Äôs disease, and not some sort of neoplasm or other malignancy. On the way out, he found two or three polyps that were removed and biopsied and I felt absolutely nothing. At its absolutely worst, the pain was MAYBE a 2/10, truly no biggie. 

The aftermath: I was in no pain at all, and got dressed immediately after returning to my little room. Took off out of there, taking my turn driving, happy to be alive and to finally have a diagnosis. I celebrated my new disease by absolutely dominating a McGriddle and taking a nap. I‚Äôve had several scopes since then, all with no sedation and the experience has been identical every time. Mind you, everyone is different and the anatomy can make colonoscopies a little trickier for the ladies, but the moral of the story is colonoscopies shouldn‚Äôt be the huge anxiety inducing event that they are, because you‚Äôre gonna be just fine!!!

I‚Äôm all the way down to answer any questions yall might have, and thanks for reading my novel üòÅüòÅüòÅ

xu53y,IBD,Friend diagnosed with UC on Monday. What can I say to her?,"A very good friend of mine was diagnosed with UC on Monday after a colonoscopy. It was shocking because the symptoms appeared very suddenly about two weeks ago. I figured a disease like this would take time to set in. I've been reading to try to understand what she's going through, but still feel at a loss of words to make her feel better. Years ago my close friend's father died from Crohns, and while I realize the two are different, it still brings back unsettling memories. Right now her energy comes and goes, I believe because she is afraid to eat much. 

I've just been trying to make her laugh, since I know it can be depressing/stressful. I'm not trying to give her medical or diet advice. That will be up to her, and her doctor. But, I'm wondering if there is anything extra I can do to support her.

yi9p9,IBD,What of me is normal?,"I'm in a weird place right now, 16 diagnose 18 Jpouch  21 in a month. It's been so long, there have been so many ""let's handle X and then we'll worry about Y later"" plus my memory is utter SHIT with my ""sleep"" patterns and overall fatigue. I seriously don't know what's normal for me any more. I can't remember what issues I've brought up, what the response was let alone what I ate last night without serious thought.

So, let's lay down what's going on right now, as I sit in my chair a nice workaround for memory issues. (...at least I can remember I have memory issues right?...)

Starting basic here we go:
* abdominal pain (duh?)

* burning acidic feeling of liquid leaking out rectum (*most* of the time *just* a feeling)

* painful ""bubble"" bursts near rectum. Starts with slow discomfort pain rises, hits peak then 
bursts in sharp pain 

* memory loss

* complete liquid BM or painful eye popping constipation, no middle ground

* ~2hr intervals of BMs at night destroying any hope of proper sleep patterns.

* constant clenching to reduce pain

* I consider headaches to be normal(they're always there). I consider migraines to be like a headache(every once in a while no big)

*there's more but like I think I said I can't remember :(

Throwing this last bit in here, because it makes me doubt myself...often. My dad 100% thinks I'm lazy, depressed, unmotivated slob (How **he feels** isn't up for debate or interpretation) and again with my memory and with my complete lack of information as to what I'm going through(and my poor on the spot communication skills) I can't remember or list reasons why I don't want to do this or that, my gut feeling is just ""no, don't go to that movie"" and then after the conversation is over, and a handful of attitude is sent my way for not wanting to do anything. I realize, oh that's right knowing your going to walk out during the movie at any time sucks, risking having to wait for an open (or non filthy) stall sucks, sitting in the same place trapped by people while you consistently fart and feel self conscious...sucks. The movie example supports my side way more. But in it's most basic form you can do an activity where you are surrounded by people not moving (preferable due to fatigue) or you can move around and risk not having a washroom/be close.

Also, worth mentioning when I'm at home and my mom wants to watch a series (even stupid ""Glass House"" or ""Take me Out"" they're silly reality shows for you more fortunate) we will ALWAYS watch it in my mom's room, if my dad makes the mistake of walking in, he will muster up an excuse and run to the basement(worse and hypocritical...?) 99% of the time, the 1% is when my mom consistently guilts him into staying. 

My GI says me waking up for BMs regularily since I was 16 doesn't affect my energy levels. I'm not lying, when the issue was raised he said ""That's unrelated"" ",https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/yi9p9/what_of_me_is_normal/,1345436078.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1l3qm4,IBD,"As an 18 year old male diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 7 years old, this is my story. (x-post from r/crohnsdisease)","I've been looking for a place to do this for a while, and I finally have found it. People ask me what it's like to live with Crohn's disease, but I say it's hard to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it. So, this is my story

From my earliest memories regarding Crohn's disease, as a kindergartener, they were really unpleasant. I was sick all of the time, and no doctor really knew what was truly wrong with me. I got the abdominal pain, I got the fevers, diharrea, vomiting, weight loss, the whole shabang. I asked my parents why none of the other kids at my school ever got sick, but they didn't really have an answer for me. 

I had countless blood tests and other tests done on me during my kindergarten year (2000), going into first grade (2001), but there were too many diagnoses to properly place what was wrong with me. One doctor (who my parents never liked in the first place) said I had cancer and that he could cure it. Needless to say, we never went back to him lol.

Going into First grade, at a new school, I was known as the kid who was sick all the time. The entire year, I missed ~45 days of school, and had Crohn's symptoms the entire time. Even in first grade, I got bullied and picked on due to the..... gaseous aromas.... that came from me. I didn't understand medical diseases very well at the time, but I then realized that whatever was wrong with me wasn't normal.

Fast forward to December of 2001. I went to Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana (I live in Indiana), and got assigned to one of the *greatest* pediatric gastroenterologists in the entire country, Dr. Joseph F. Fitzgerald. To describe how good he is, here is an excerpt from his page on Riley's website: ""Dr. Fitzgerald is one of the pioneers of pediatric endoscopy (procedure using a tiny video camera to look inside the digestive track) and was the founding director of pediatric gastroenterology at Riley Hospital for Children in 1969, a post he held until 2005."" [Here are some of his awards.](http://www.rileydocs.com/physicians/jfitzgerald) I went for a few visits, and then had a colonoscopy. After viewing the photos of my intestines, the doctors made an easy decision, and sure enough, on December 21st, 2001, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. I don't remember much from that day, but the only thing I remember was that on the way home, I looked up at the winter solstice sky and saw a shooting star, and thought, 'my life is not going to be the same with Crohn's'. Turns out I was correct! Life with Crohn's was awful. The pain was so bad at times, that I refused to eat, and lied on the couch in the fetal position because the pain was so bad. I didn't get out of bed at times because I didn't want to have to eat and feel the pain shoot through my abdomen. 

The details of how my treatment are fuzzy to me, but I know I was put on different medications, including Prednisone, Asacol, Imuran, and eventually Remicaid via IV infusions. The Prednisone phase was quite terrible for me, and my life at school as a 2nd grader. My classmates never understood why I suddenly looked way fatter than I did last year, and made fun of me for it. I don't know if you could call it depression, but I definitely didn't feel happy during the prednisone days. Eventually, I started the Remicade infusions at Riley Hospital in Indianapolis, and that allowed me to be taken off of Prednisone. I remember the IV infusions being long, painful, and tear-ridden. I already didn't like needles, and I was quite scared to be in a hospital getting an infusion. The treatments lasted hours and hours. The nurses at Riley are top notch, and definitely deserve a shoutout in this post. They helped me get through those painful times. My worst memory with Remicade at Riley Main had to be when they tried time after time to find a vein, but couldn't. It took them 12 different times to find a vein, in 12 different spots on my left and right arms. At one point, I was crying but tears didn't come out. I ran out of tears because I cried so much. Eventually, they got a vein to cooperate; I was at Riley for over 8 hours, for an infusion that should've lasted about 3. 

I will stand by this post when I say that Remicade saved me. No, not from death, but from immense pain and suffering. As soon as I was on it for enough time, my symptoms started to recede. The pain that electrified my nervous system when I ate went down, and I was able to go off of the Prednisone. I stayed on Asacol and Imuran, obviously, but I was overjoyed that I wouldn't have to take that terrible-tasting pill ever again. The cycle of taking Asacol/Imuran and going for Remicade infusions lasted for quite a few years after that. After my blood tests came back negative for any symptoms, I was cautiously taken off of Imuran. Fast forward a few years or so. Still no symptoms. Dr. Fitzgerald then took me off of Asacol. And then, during 6th grade or so, I was taken off of Remicade altogether. 

So where was I at? After about 5 years of treatment, with guidance from the --arguably-- greatest Pediatric GI doctor to ever exist, I was a Crohn's patient in complete remission. I was told that my Crohn's still existed, so I needed to be careful with what I eat. My no-no's in terms of food are **caffeine**--most important, which includes coffee, chocolate, some sodas, energy drinks, tea, etc--, nuts, skins of fruits, alcohol--obviously lol--, seeds in fruits. Going through middle school, I embraced the fact that I could pretty much eat what I want with no consequences. And that mindset worked. I had no Crohn's symptoms, even from eating lots of chocolate at one time. These are some of the best years of my life with Crohn's, I felt like I no longer had to worry about any side effects....

...Until the summer going into 9th grade. I remember it well, my family went on a vacation to Florida to visit my grandparents there. 2 days after we got there, I started getting sick. I didn't think much of it, but when I felt that certain pain, on that certain spot on my right-abdomen, I knew what it was. I didn't want it to be true. It couldn't be. I've never told anyone this before, but that night with the pain back (it was a decently bad pain), I cried. A lot. I didn't want to be a Crohn's kid again; I wanted to be someone who didn't have to worry about what they ate. But unfortunately, that's reality. The pain, along with the diarrhea, fever, and vomiting (1 time) ruined that trip to Florida. As soon as I got back, we scheduled into Riley as soon as we possibly could. Sure enough, blood tests confirmed that my Crohn's was flaring up again, and pretty badly. 

Luckily, I was told that I didn't need Prednisone again. I was told to start taking Asacol again, and that I would be getting Remicade again also. Sure enough, after doing that for a number of months, my symptoms gradually faded away. However, not completely. I never even touched any food or drink that I wasn't supposed to have. I was in high school now, and my classmates understood by now what I was going through. On a humorous note, many of my friends loved to drink Mountain Dew or eat chocolate in front of me, to see what I'd say. Lots of times my response was ""Fuck you!"" lol (You know who you are *ahemBK&BPahem*). 

Now, this whole story has been filled with doom and gloom. But why not end it with a happy note? More recently, I just started college at Purdue University in West Lafeyette, Indiana. At first, I was terrified at the fact that I'd be living in a dorm with a roommate, using a public bathroom and shower, being judged every time the side-effects of Crohn's were revealed. However, I was told by new doctor--[Dr. Steven Steiner](http://www.rileydocs.com/physicians/ssteiner)--that I could obtain a single room with a private bathroom/shower (Purdue has dorms like these). All he had to do was write a letter, and I fill out a specific form saying I had a medical reason for them to give me this medical accommodation. Needless to say, it worked! I am living in a dorm with just that. No roommate, and a shower and bathroom to myself. But, why not put the icing on the cake? At Purdue, Freshmen aren't allowed to have their cars on campus. However, there's a way to get a car as a Freshman--medical visits being one of them! Dr. Steiner wrote another letter, I filled out a form, and just like that, I'm able to have my car on campus! I like to tell people that it's a huge positive coming from a huge negative :)

So Reddit, that's my story. It's been terrible at times, but right now, I am currently in a ~85% remission state, receiving Remicade once every 8 weeks in Indianapolis. But, even though I'm 18 and a college student, Dr. Steiner promised me he would stay my GI doctor as long as he possibly can. I am very, very happy with how I am feeling. At times, I still experience symptoms. Soft stools, smelly farts, the usual.  I am looking forward to the future, for new treatments, studies, and maybe even a cure someday. I raise money for the [CCFA](http://ccfa.org) every year, and I plan to do so for as long as I can.

1ixrp6q,CrohnsDisease,A cure for IBD,"Interesting article in New Scientist mag yesterday about new treatments for autoimmune diseases including IBD that might offer a cure. I got ChatGPT AI to summarise it: 

The article from New Scientist explores groundbreaking therapies that aim to cure autoimmune diseases by reprogramming the immune system, potentially offering lasting relief for conditions like type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Key Points:

1. Background on Autoimmune Diseases
Autoimmune diseases arise when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells due to faulty B- and T-cells. Current treatments, such as immunosuppressants, only alleviate symptoms but leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer.


2. New Approaches to Treatment

CAR-T Therapy: Originally used in cancer treatment, this approach involves modifying T-cells to eliminate malfunctioning immune cells. Early trials in lupus patients show that a single treatment can induce long-term remission.

Navacims (Nanomedicines): Developed by immunologist Pere Santamaria, these tiny particles reprogram faulty immune cells to suppress, rather than promote, autoimmunity. Trials show promise in diseases like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.

Liver-Based Tolerance Therapy: Researchers exploit the liver‚Äôs natural ability to suppress immune reactions by designing ""inverse vaccines,"" which retrain the immune system to tolerate specific self-antigens. This method has shown success in reversing symptoms in animal models.

mRNA-Based Therapies: Inspired by COVID-19 vaccine technology, researchers are exploring mRNA treatments that could instruct the body to generate immune-regulating cells, preventing attacks on self-antigens.

3. Challenges and Outlook

While these therapies are promising, they come with risks, including potential infections and high costs (CAR-T therapy costs over $600,000 per treatment).

Long-term effects remain unclear, requiring further clinical trials.

Despite these hurdles, scientists are optimistic that these new treatments could provide a long-term solution, replacing broad immunosuppression with precise immune correction.

The article concludes with cautious optimism, suggesting that after decades of research, a true cure for autoimmune diseases may soon be within reach.

I'm 82 so I probably won't benefit from it!

The British Society of Gastroenterology published new guidelines on IBD and I felt like some of the takeaways could be really helpful (and were some things I would love to go back a year and share with myself), so I wanted to share. Specifically, 3 things that felt like they could be impactful for helping us work with our care teams:

1. Biologics earlier: If your Crohn's looks aggressive, doctors might now recommend starting with biologics right away and not wait to ""fail"" other meds. This feels huge. I spent the better part of the last year suffering in a severe flare while I worked through budesonide (failed) -> prednisone (helped so much for limited times) -> Humira (failed) -> Rinvoq (failed). Ultimately ended up getting the bowel resection before I got a chance to move on to Tremfya (which I'm starting in a few weeks).

2. Track often: The new standard is full remission, not just feeling okay. That means regular tracking of things like bloodwork, calprotectin, and CRP to guide treatment. I love the idea of the guidelines being more proactive here with regular tracking. Also, for those of you asking ""do I have Crohn's"", an ileocolonoscopy is still noted as the gold standard for diagnosis. And fecal calprotectin is recommended as the first go-to test. Both are great to ask your doctor about if it hasn't been a discussion yet!

3. Mental health is part of care: Fatigue, stress, diet, and emotional health are finally being taken seriously and support should be part of your treatment plan. As we all know, Crohn's takes such a huge toll. I see so many posts here with people just looking for support and connection. I'm lucky enough to have been in therapy for the past couple years, but I definitely felt like Crohn's and my lifestyle changes became a big topic over the past year.

Anyway, I hope this was helpful! I was genuinely really excited to see this (and ACG's from earlier in the month). If anyone else went through the new guidelines, please share some takeaways!

1jv8j6l,CrohnsDisease,Witnessing lots of confusion regarding IBD vs IBS,"I am wondering where all this confusion regarding differences in the extremity, symptoms, and treatment of IBD vs IBS is coming from.

I have been coming across more and more people with IBS who claim to identify with those who have bowel diseases such as Crohn‚Äôs.

It seems like this confusion can be particularly harmful since IBS can be treated with food or lifestyle changes while IBD patients are often limited to more extensive treatments and complex forms of medical intervention. 

Is anyone willing to share some ways we can differentiate ourselves from those with IBS and help to educate others on the severity of our disease? I think it‚Äôs really important for people to know IBD ‚â† IBS without getting ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a competition‚Äù spat in our faces :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1jv8j6l/witnessing_lots_of_confusion_regarding_ibd_vs_ibs/,1744212415.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
1i8lfmk,CrohnsDisease,New study: wearables can detect gut inflammation in IBD weeks before a painful episode occurs.,"Published last week, the study tracked wearable data along with self-reported symptoms and blood and stool samples from over 300 Irritable Bowel Disease IBD patients across 36 US states.

Gut inflammation bouts were accompanied by  characteristic changes in the daily patterns of heart rate variability HRV, blood oxygenation, resting heart rate RHR in addition to a decrease in daily steps. Moreover, the characteristic changes can also predict asymptomatic inflammation preceding painful bouts by up to 7 weeks, giving a precious warning signal to patients to help them best prevent and manage the bouts.

1lpyw2x,CrohnsDisease,My Research into Diet and IBD: What the Literature Actually Says (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Complicated),"Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster. I‚Äôve been trying to learn more about the role of diet in IBD after ignoring it for years due to all the conflicting advice from different doctors over the years. Multiple told me diet has nothing to do with Crohn‚Äôs, while others pushed me toward specialized diets. That disconnect made me curious, so I started reading into the actual research.

Here‚Äôs a rough summary of what I found:

* **Patients care deeply about diet**‚Äîand most believe it plays a major role in their symptoms and flares.
* **Doctors don't all agree it matters**, but they often don‚Äôt have clear guidelines to offer because the science is still fuzzy.
* **The overall certainty of evidence for specific diets is still ‚Äúlow‚Äù or ‚Äúvery low.‚Äù**¬†That doesn‚Äôt mean diet doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîit just means most studies have been small, underpowered, or hard to generalize.

Some of the diets that have been clinically validated include:

**Mediterranean Diet vs. Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD):**  
The DINE-CD trial (Lewis et al., 2021) compared these two head-to-head in patients with mild to moderate Crohn‚Äôs. Both diets led to similar rates of symptom relief, but neither showed superiority in reducing inflammation markers. The takeaway was that dietary change¬†*can*¬†improve symptoms, but it may not always impact underlying inflammation.

**Crohn‚Äôs Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED):**  
In pediatric studies like Levine et al. (2019), CDED combined with partial enteral nutrition (PEN) showed similar efficacy to exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for inducing remission, but with better adherence. It‚Äôs a multi-phase diet that eliminates common triggers and supports gut barrier repair. It seems promising but also a lot to manage without support.

**Low-FODMAP Diet:**  
Originally for IBS, but has shown effectiveness in reducing functional symptoms (bloating, pain, gas) in IBD patients without active inflammation. It‚Äôs not meant to reduce inflammation itself. Cox et al. (2020) is one of the studies that supports this for symptom relief in IBD with IBS-like features.

**Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN):**  
Strongest evidence base, especially in pediatric Crohn‚Äôs. ESPEN and ECCO guidelines recommend it as first-line therapy in children, with efficacy similar to steroids but without the side effects. It‚Äôs tough to stick with, especially for adults, but it proves that diet¬†*can*¬†induce remission under strict conditions.

So far, the research seems to suggest there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all ‚ÄúIBD diet.‚Äù What works symptom-wise for one person might do nothing for someone else. And the impact on actual inflammation is still unclear for most diets. That said, there are signs that personalized approaches, structured elimination, symptom tracking, etc., might be the future of where this is going.

Curious if anyone else has had doctors tell them completely different things about food and IBD? And have you found any diet that actually helped in a measurable way, beyond just reducing bloating or discomfort?

I have had gut issues for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve met several other people with IBD and other chronic illnesses, most of them also were abused in some way. I find it rather interesting in a sad way. I‚Äôve been talking to a therapist for some time now, and he‚Äôs trying to help me basically rewire my brain to not be in constant fight or flight. I‚Äòm making progress, but it‚Äôs slow. When I find myself feeling anxious, which is often, I basically have to talk to myself and remind myself that I‚Äôm ok, I‚Äôm not in danger, and I‚Äôm starting to notice that when I do that, my gut calms down.

I politely pointed out that IBS isn‚Äôt the same thing as IBD - mentioned inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease, and the fact that there‚Äôs likely a genetic component to these conditions. 

She kind of brushed it off and got a tiny bit defensive, and mentioned IBS again. I didn‚Äôt want to pursue it further with a stranger I barely know, but I‚Äôve seen this confusion happen before. Part of me wants to educate people - IBS, while still rough, isn‚Äôt the autoimmune mess of a condition that IBD is.

1fob8n5,CrohnsDisease,My Crohn‚Äôs finally won,"As I type this, I do it with tears in my eyes. I have battled Crohn‚Äôs for 7 1/2 years, and have had periods of remission, and flares. I would say collectively I have had 3 1/2 years of flare and 3 1/2 years of remission. During this time, I have developed a stricture at my terminal ileum as many of you do. 2 years ago I discovered what a bowel obstruction was, and was in the hospital for only 2 days. For 2 years now, I have avoided the hospital somehow, and avoided another obstruction. I have been on prednisone on and off, Stelara failed, I had a year of success on Imuran and Remicade. Rinvoq never worked at all. Humira worked until it didn‚Äôt, same for Entivyo. 

I am currently on Cimzia with 6MP. I actually just finished the loading doses so it‚Äôs been 4 weeks. During those 4 weeks, I was able to come off the prednisone completely. I had good days and bad days, but I could tell the med was working. That changed sadly. This disease is so unpredictable, and I literally went to bed fine and woke up in a flare last Tuesday and have remained in a flare since. To say I‚Äôm defeated is an understatement. Why is my body so good at defending against these meds? Sometimes I want to say JUST CHILL TF OUT BRO!

Anyways, so now I‚Äôm back on prednisone. Yes, I still have Skyrizi as an option, but at this point why? Even if it did work, it will eventually stop, and I will need surgery. I can‚Äôt tell you how petrified I am of surgery. I had aortic valve replacement when I was 11 for a congenital defect. I have been great since that surgery, but deep down I‚Äôm still that little boy clinging to his mothers neck as they were wheeling me back to the OR, begging for her to stop them from doing the surgery because I was sure I was going to die.

I‚Äôm 30, years old now. 2 kids and a wife. I love them more than anything in this universe. I have never felt so alone. Not because my wife doesn‚Äôt support me. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm scared to tell her that I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared to tell her that I‚Äôm afraid l‚Äôll die during surgery and leave her a widow. I‚Äôm scared that i will leave my kids behind. Now if you ask the doctors, oh everything will be fine, we do these operations everyday! But deep down, I‚Äôm still that 11 year old boy who is scared.

I have contacted the surgeon and I‚Äôm waiting for a surgery date. As bad as I hate it, I have no choice. I don‚Äôt want another bowel obstruction. I can‚Äôt stay on prednisone forever (and btw that has always worked but even it is starting to lose its effectiveness). I want this surgery on my terms, not because I have another bowel obstruction and they have to do it unplanned, and they are shoving an NG tube down my nose. I want this to be a controlled situation as possible. I‚Äôm sorry for the long message. I typed this to just say, I will be having surgery, my Crohn‚Äôs has finally won.

1i44bkn,CrohnsDisease,What did the earliest signs of Crohn‚Äôs look like for you guys?,"Since september until now, I‚Äôve been having nasty fevers at least 2-3 a week. Other than that I look pretty healthy. I‚Äôve been admitted to the hospital for the fevers. I‚Äôve seen 2 infectious disease doctors, a nephrologist, a hema-oncologist, and a rheumatologist.

One infectious disease doctor was the one who wanted me to see a rheumatologist because he said that inflammations can cause my fever hinting that it might be Crohn‚Äôs. So I see the rheumatologist and thinks that it might be IBD as well but more specifically he wrote UC. So, he wanted me to see my GI. 

When I saw my GI, he wasn‚Äôt convinced that it was IBD because he said fevers arent normally associated with it. Despite my biopsy which found crypt abscesses and a high fecal calprotectin, he was doubting because I had no remarkable diarrhea, blood in stool or abdominal pain. I really just have weekly high fevers. Anyway, he gave me Pentasa to test the waters. I‚Äôve been on it since last week and I‚Äôm happy the fevers finally stopped at least for now. 

I saw another GI just today for a second opinion. He isn‚Äôt convinced either because apparently after 30 years of specializing in IBD, he said fever was rare. He did say tho that blood in stool isn‚Äôt necessary to diagnose IBD. 

But in the end, NOBODY knows what I have. I‚Äôm so tired of the fevers I was really hoping this was it; that it would finally be something. Instead, I have 2 infectious doctors saying it‚Äôs auto immune and now I have 2 GI doctors refuting the idea of IBD. 

All this to ask, did anyone go through something similar? This has been driving me nuts‚Ä¶

 So much stress coming her way from her overbearing parents as we are going on holiday together as 'it will be de-stressing for her.' 

They've experienced the last two summers of their daughter being hospitalised yet still don't recognise they are causing so much damn stress to someone who is meant to avoid stress. 

Just felt i needed some yelling into the void about this shitty disease and the insanity of familial bonds making things additionally more challenging. 

Do you have any tips on how to support my loved one through this challenging time or perhaps a story to share of shitty parents making things worse ha!

1m3hta1,CrohnsDisease,"Suspected Crohn‚Äôs- can immodium make a flare WORSE, cause a histamine dump, or just not work? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if immodium caused the problem or situational anxiety.","So basically I‚Äôve had diarrhea on and off for 6 months. This past month the abdominal pain has been crippling and sent me to the ER and I got a clear CT and orders for a colonoscopy which is going to be on 7/28. I‚Äôm so excited to hopefully get diagnosed and find a path forward because I can‚Äôt really eat food right now and am having diarrhea 5x a day and while the stomach pain isn‚Äôt as bad it‚Äôs still there and I can feel my intestines are inflamed.

Anyways the first (and last) time I tried immodium was like 2 months ago. I took it before going to the grocery store and the grocery store always gives me diarrhea (anxiety and just like walking around I guess) and I was doing great until I was almost done. Then I got a HOT FLASH from hell and had to run to the bathroom and nearly abandon a full cart of groceries- I had diarrhea like the kind that leaves you sweating and shaking and feeling like you‚Äôre going to vomit. I went out to the car and was physically shaking and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe (all the symptoms of a panic attack/histamine dump as I have MCAS and suspected histamine intolerance) for the next 15min and my HR was 150+. And then it went away.

I was able to go back in and check out my groceries then hurry home. But I guess my question is- does this sound like an immodium reaction? I‚Äôve only had reactions that severe when I took immodium. Otherwise I‚Äôve just had diarrhea once or twice in the store but nothing THAT BAD.

I hear from everyone here how great immodium is and I‚Äôm tempted to try it again but afraid whatever panic attack/hellish histamine dump it triggered in me before would happen again. I normally just use dicyclominenfor the pain and spasms.

I am a long-time Crohn's patient.  Diagnosed at age 10, now 36, and have been in what seems to be a 2-year-long flare.  Not every day is a complete 0/10, but most are not great.  Dealing with chronic illness for so long, I think I have reached a breaking point.  I no longer want to make doctor appointments, take medicine, or eat right, as it is all too much for me now.  I am still doing what I can to take care of myself, but some days are really tough, and weigh on me mentally.  I have been doing therapy since December 2022 and it has helped, but my therapist recommended I discuss with a psychiatrist to start some proper meds to help with my built-up anxiety and depression from this disease.  

I'm curious, if you suffer from Crohn's/colitis/IBD/IBS, and also have anxiety/depression - what has worked for you?  I've tried Lexipro, but even the starting 5mg dose made me feel like an absolute zombie.

So I have been diagnosed with crohns since december of last year, and the disease has not really given me any really bad symptoms. But a couple of months ago I started having panic attacks where my breathing gets laboured, cold sweats, etc. It is in a period where there is a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen next as well. I am currently a pilot student and so far the disease has not really gotten in the way of my medical licence, but now I have been switched from a private GI to a GI connected to a hospital, and they are talking about starting me on a maintenance drug, they are talking about either Azathioprine or Adalimumab, but the panic attacks started before this, but has gotten worse / more frequent since this. It has gotten to a point where I struggle to leave the house because I fear that I might get a panic attack, and they primarily happen when I am not at home. I am curious to see if anyone else has expeirenced this or something similar? or if people have any advice besides seeing a therapist? My current plan is to wait until I actually start a maintenance drug, and to see if it calms down after that, and if not, I will visit a therapist. My current suspicion is that this is stress related due to all the uncertainty around my disease at the moment.

 I was 16 years old at that time, completely healthy. (Though I had some abdomen pains as a child 2 or 3 times but they went away on their own) 
Few days before having Crohn‚Äôs related symptoms I had my first panic attack and it was the worst. I had no idea what the hell was happening to me, I literally thought that I was about to die. My heart was racing, I was sweating, trembling, and pacing around the room. Few weeks later, the first symptoms started to appear. Fatigue, skin problems like dermatitis, my gums started to bleed, my joints started to ache, I would get tired more easily etc. It was funny though because my bowels didn‚Äôt bother me at all and I couldn‚Äôt believe that It was actually Crohn‚Äôs.

So my question is: Can panic attacks be the first symptom of Crohn‚Äôs? Because I NEVER had them before and right after it happened I‚Äôve started getting my first actual autoimmune disease symptoms.

1lkdxhx,CrohnsDisease,Stricture or Just Stress?,"Just got home from vacation yesterday, and while it was a good vacation, it was slightly marred by the development of not one, but two anal fissures!  (Both resulted from sitting in a car traveling over 4000 miles in the space of six days.)  The fissures have pretty much healed up, but for the past 48 hours, I haven't been going much--or rather, I've been going 3-4 times a day, but not much has been coming out.  What comes out looks normal, no blood or anything, but...just not much there.  It also took longer than usual for things to get moving, and it feels like things are hanging up right at the end...if you know what I mean, and you probably do.

This morning, I had a fairly normal BM and just now some diarrhea.  Otherwise I feel fine, other than a bit of pain on the lower left side over my hip, which has been coming and going for the last month.

Since I've been traveling, I haven't been eating remotely right, with fast food for dinner and road snacks otherwise, and yesterday we were so tired and got home so late I went right to bed without eating anything substantial.  Normally, I wouldn't worry too much, but 1) I've got Crohn's and 2) I'm a hypochondriac, so I'm wondering if this is a stricture, constipation, stress from a long vacation, or even stenosis from healing fissures.

I see my primary doctor tomorrow--routine checkup--so I'll be sure to ask and have her take a look, but I also wouldn't mind some advice from fellow Crohnies.  My GI doctor quit last week and moved away, so I won't see my new GI doc until August, but my primary is pretty sharp.  I'm also due to start Stelara next month as well, which I'm dreading and looking forward to at the same time.

I'm a 23-year-old guy, and I was officially diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2016 (though I had symptoms since 2014).

It affected my growth and puberty ‚Äî I was always smaller and skinnier than others. People made fun of me, even if it wasn‚Äôt meant to be hurtful, I always got comments about my body. It shattered my self-confidence.  
And it hit me at the worst time ‚Äî during adolescence. I still carry the scars today. But I also blame myself for not having the courage to seek help sooner.

Over the years, I‚Äôve been on immunosuppressants, had surgery, IV treatments, and subcutaneous Remicade.  
In 2023, I stopped all treatments on my own (yeah, I know, that was dumb).

Recently, after losing over 12 kg, I finally decided to contact a doctor again. I also deal with a bunch of secondary issues ‚Äî skin problems, hair loss... and honestly, it‚Äôs making me pretty depressed.

I work from home, I don‚Äôt see anyone, I never go out. I‚Äôm alone, and I don‚Äôt even have the energy or desire to take care of myself anymore.

I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for me, but right now, it looks pretty dark.

They found two small little ulcerations in the ileum after a month of 5-7 BMs a day, elevated heart rate, SVTs, and a few other symptoms. No blood. Normal ESR and C-Reactive Protein.

I just tapered off budesonide last week. Now dealing with withdrawal symptoms from that. We told to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see how it goes‚Äù until my pill endoscopy next week. My bowels are back up to 4-5 a day. I was told that can also be a side effect of coming off the steroid so hang tight until we can get me scoped. The only thing that gave me some hope was when I got a second opinion from an IBD specialist at NYU. She told me she did not think I had Crohn‚Äôs unless it was so early in the onset that I caught it basically the month it was starting. She wondered if I had Bechet‚Äôs or another autoimmune disease instead causing the problems,  but my rheum ruled Bechet‚Äôs out immediately since I don‚Äôt have mouth or genital sores.

I know in my gut that all of these symptoms aren‚Äôt just a coincidence. Now that I‚Äôm off the steroids my SVT episodes are coming back, which we speculated was being triggered due to inflammation triggering my heart. The BMs are back.

A little background, in March, I was admitted to the ER with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, etc. A CT scan revealed a small blockage (not sure where) and I spent a total of 9 days in the hospital. After 4 or 5 days of IV fluids for bowel rest, I was not getting any better. A colonoscopy was finally performed, and diverticulitis was found. I was on IV antibiotics and tons of vitamins (they said I was malnourished) for the rest of my stay, and then a little over a week after. Everything was fine until May when I had another flare. CT showed the DV this time, so I was sent home with antibiotics. Then, there was another flare this past Friday; I am still on antibiotics until Monday. 

In April, I saw my GI who wanted me to get a MRE to rule out any inflammatory conditions. She was sure I had none and that this would end that particular journey. I had the scan on Tuesday, still in random pain from what I thought was only a DV flare. Well, today she called me and told me that I have severe Crohn's and that she was shocked by my results. Multiple fistulas, multiple strictures, tons of inflammation. So she wants to get me into an infusion treatment ASAP for Remicade. I am still spinning/spiraling. Can anyone help me understand what this means for me? How is this treatment? Will it make me sick? I have a planned vacation in September and feel like the combination of stomach stuff is going to ruin my chance of being able to go. It doesn't help that I have severe anxiety (like most people these days). For context, if it helps, I'm a 33  year old female in the US.

17ammzn,CrohnsDisease,Another crohnie journey,"Hi there.

I really regret not being engaged and active in the community all these years and really appreciate all of you who did and shared their stories and experience giving everyone affected some sense of relatability. **It does help!**

**Short background.**

Got diagnosed in 2018, in the middle of the second year of my post-graduate program: ass turned into a shit-blaster for a few months, then severe pain, hospital, resection, ileostomy for three months and finally reversal. Pushed through, got my PhD in Bioinformatics/Biophysics, founded a startup (currently active). In Feb 2022 got invited to work as a post-doc on a big Alzheimer's Disease project in the US, moved here and has been living in Orange County till today.

After surgery I made the worst decision - complete denial and medical negligence of my condition. The only medication I have ever received was methylprednisolone for a short period of time before and after surgery. Surgery did put me into remission, but apparently mentally I was not ready, and decided to put all of the gained ""healthy"" time it gave me into work, hoping to end up in a better circumstance to handle all of the issues related to CD before its relapse (recurrence). Obviously, this strategy f\*\*\*ed me up 10-fold. Got colonoscopy right before coming to the US: acute inflammation \~10 cm, GI back home advised to start biologics asap in the US. Got slapped financially and just overall dealing with the US healthcare system. Good news, apparently moving to the USA somehow slightly reduced my inflammation (probably microbiome related, there are some studies of such scenarios). Bad news, still need to start biologics + now have a fistula that is a bit big to be handled by biologics. According to my local GI, it is not urgent (well that was 3-4 months ago, so atm I guess it is now...üòÅ), so I need to organize a surgery and only after to start therapy.

***Correlated issues.***

***Depression.*** Damn. Going to leave this for another time. But overall, I would take CD over it without hesitation (not to offend people with the most severe cases of CD, that are probably worse; or to be honest I would not even compare these two, since its completely different form of ""suffering""). My continuous medical negligence led to constant malnutrition, vitamins and microelements deficiency, hormonal changes and all of that was basically equivalent of putting gasoline on fire. ***ADHD-like symptoms.*** Had ADHD-like symptoms for a quite a time, very mild, didn't seriously affect any part of my life, until this last 1-1.5 years, with the worst periods happened just recently. **Short and long memory deterioration.** All of the above caused serious issues and affected both of them. ***Energy deprivation, Brain fog.*** Well, I am sure you all aware.

**Present and Future.**

Well fortunately all of the work I have done before did put me in a relatively secure position that I was able to maintain and will for at least the upcoming year or two but that is not what's important.

Surprisingly, going through all of this I never lost my ambitions and I believe I finally was able to rationalize through my personal issues (obviously not everything related to CD, but surely affected by it), found my path and long-awaited peace of mind, which enabled me to stand up again and move forward with calm and confidence.

So, basically, I decided to transition to CD research and dedicate my future to it, regardless of circumstances. Going to be quite a challenge for me to make it happen (Can't run away from obligations, tbh neither I want to). So, besides my startup and work on Alzheimer's disease, I am going to dedicate all my time to CD research, gradually transitioning to it as a major direction. My previous expertise had barely directly crossed with immunology, and I have only a general understanding of it, at the same time it is one of the most complex biological fields with a lot of gaps both in theory and experimental field yet to be discovered/understood. However, I have nothing but an overwhelming curiosity that pushed me to study biology and chemistry when I was a kid.

**So, what's the actual plan?**

1) Quite simple, currently I try to dedicate all my free time to deepen my knowledge in general immunology and moving forward in autoimmune processes and microbiome. Simultaneously I started writing a review article of everything that happened in CD/IBD field up to date (including, chronology of discoveries, existing and investigational treatments/approaches, future directions) and hopefully will publish it in some reputable journal in upcoming future (will take \~ approx. 3-4 months to submit it). At the same time, I already came to an agreement with my director at my institution to work on this field as a PI, which basically allows me to apply for grants and governmental funding and start working on this directly in the lab.

2) Manage my diet and start consistently going to gym (I was quite athletic bak in a day. .

**Have not yet decided how to organize it, but honestly, it will bring me great joy to be proactive and engage in a community, mainly by free online lectures/presentations digesting (üòÅ) complex scientific topics, research and data in CD to the general audience. Why not maybe even share some personal stories and experiences too, hopefully not only about an uncountable amount of times I (almost) shitted myself!**

**Not want to run to far away into future, but I believe if I will find a way to organize it in interactive way (being in constant direct communication with a lot of people affected by this disease), it will put me in a very unique position as a researcher, helping to approach it in a way more comprehensive and effective way (being quite selfish here).**

I do not expect anything particular from this post, in a sense it also serves me purpose of self-accountability. 

But I would greatly appreciate any feedback and advice.

Wish everyone the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/17ammzn/another_crohnie_journey/,1697621713.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
v39hfr,CrohnsDisease,Yo,"One person can speak about their own personal hell and gets 2 likes and zero responses while another person whines about collecting poop or being tired and gets hundreds of likes and replies. 

And let's not forget the inevitable attention seeker who just has to post a picture of their prep (why? I don't care, I've seen Moviprep 10 zillion times) or a cannula in their arm (again, why?). 

Yeah, I'm an asshole. I don't care. You are welcome to ban me. I'm 47 years old, there is no help or support, and I am extremely petrified of growing old. Every day I think about how I'm going to commit suicide if I lose my home or if the pain gets too much to bear. Every. Single. Day. Thanks to the religious freaks and the rich freaks making obscene money from minimum wage staff spoon-feeding demented adults in care homes, my hope of a quick, painless death are virtually zero. Every day I try to think of a painless suicide method, but all the painless methods have been removed from me: barbituates, guns, gas ovens, etc. All modern day drugs are useless for killing yourselves with. So what else does that leave? Hanging? That's what my brother chose. However, at the moment I don't have enough courage for that and besides I would need a room with higher ceilings and a beam - there's nothing like that in my flat. Throwing myself in front of a train? That's a possibility, but despite me being an utter cunt I don't really want to traumatise a train driver. Besides, supposing it goes wrong and I cripple myself for life or turn into a vegetable (I mean, even more than I already am one) already? 

There's no surefire, quick, easy method for killing yourself. Perhaps dying of cold is the easiest way, but I live in a shit country which doesn't get that cold - still, a mountain in Scotland in winter should probs do it, to be fair. 

Anyway, this is the REAL shit which older sufferers of incurable chronic illness should be talking about. How do we off ourselves when we get old and everyone has left and you're just left shitting yourself in a flat with annoying neighbours day after day? 

If you need your fake ""hope"" so badly, most folks with Crohn's will do okay long term - it's not a disease which kills you (unfortunately). But most folks with Crohn's have families, jobs, hobbies, what the fucking cunt ever.

But carry on whining about fatigued or in pain forever whilst castigating me for being negative. The hypocrisy really makes sense. On the one hand, most of you want to whine until the cows come home 5000 times over, but on the other hand you also want your fake hope and your fake optimism. Which is it you want more? I don't give a shit what you decide, but don't blame me for depressing you. It ain't my responsibility to cheer you up. I can count the number of GENUINELY happy adults I've known on the fingers of one hand, and they were just naturally like that. 

I suspect 99% of positivity (particularly online) is as fake as absolute shit, but I can't prove it and, hey, if it's the only thing preventing you from killing yourself, I don't really care. Just don't downvote me because YOU can't cope with bad feelings/thoughts. That shit triggers me. It oughtn't to, but it does. Undiagnosed personality disorder, in all probability. 

Anyway let's talk about the millions of old people living in incurable pain or suffering for a minute. Why do we let dementia sufferers piss and shit themselves, unable to talk or walk, for years in old care homes? I literally cannot think of a worse way to die. And no, you won't kill yourself if you get a dementia diagnosis. You won't kill yourself because by the time you have enough symptoms to merit a diagnosis, you literally will not be capable of killing yourself. The final stage of alzheimers can take up to 10 years to play out: that's 10 years of not being able to walk, talk, think or do anything. You have the literal intelligence at that stage of a baby. Lovely disease, eh? 

I used to absolutely believe in modern science and medicine as a force for good. The older I get, the more I wonder about that. I certainly could not bear to give up central heating (although that's rapidly becoming unaffordable for a lot of people in the UK), and it's nice to know that a simple infection won't kill me anymore. But what is the point of prolonging life to the point where millions of old people are living in absolute misery, but cannot die because we won't let them die. 

It's absolutely terrifying. 

Weirdly enough, my (relatively) healther older brother thought I had an advantage because I was already used to hospitals and illness. He was dreading growing old because he had never experienced these things. I am dreading growing old because I have. 

Yeah, wall of text I know. Don't care. I am a total cunt and asshole. Yeah I know. Don't care. I am ""entitled"" (Reddit's favourite buzzword, especially about women). Yeah I know. Don't care.

a02sye,CrohnsDisease,"""Let food by the medicine and let medicine by the food."" - Hippocrates","Hippocrates understanding of disease was far greater than today's doctors.  

""Look well to the spine for the cause of disease."" - (that's where the Central Nervous System is located)  

The Central Nervous System controls your immune system along with many other functions. Doctors today say it's impossible to treat the Central Nervous System, such as cases like Alzheimers, degenerative diseases, because the CNS can't repair. Yet...

Hippocrates was not only treating diseases from the Central Nervous System 2500 years ago, a supposed impossible feat, but he was good at it, and used food as medicine. Plants, herbs, nuts, fruits, meat, fish, eggs, etc.  

There was a really simple solution. It worked for me, one plant resolved all my Crohn's Disease problems, Cat's Claw. 8 years free of Crohn's Disease, a supposed impossible feat but it was easy. I can eat any food I want to again and never have to worry about bathrooms. I sincerely say this with the bottom of my heart, modern medicine ain't medicine.   

Besides Cat's Claw, the most influential force on my immune system is wireless technology. I would also recommend using wired connections and keeping your phone on airplane mode at night. The nervous system is sensitive to electricity and bombarding it with electricity 24/7 is terrible for any disease. Also see:

**The end of inflammation? New approach could treat dozens of diseases.**

Cancer, aging, and severe COVID-19 have all been linked to damage from inflammation. Now scientists are flipping their focus to find new drugs that may revolutionize treatments.

ByConnie Chang

Published March 4, 2022

‚Ä¢ 12 min read

Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Lauren Finney Harden had always had allergies. But after she moved to New York City for her first job in 2007, inflammation ‚Äújust exploded‚Äù throughout her body.

‚ÄúI had insane full-body rashes and strange gastro issues. I‚Äôd get massive burps that made me feel like I needed to throw up, but nothing would come up but air,‚Äù she says. Eventually, she was diagnosed with lupus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body‚Äôs own tissues and organs. She was put on a drug called prednisone, a corticosteroid that tamps down inflammation.

But the cure, at times, felt worse than the disease. ‚ÄúI looked four months pregnant all the time,‚Äù Finney Harden says, ‚Äúand I‚Äôd get cold sores every other week; my body could not fight off anything.‚Äù

Finney Harden‚Äôs experience is unfortunately a common one with traditional autoimmune treatments like prednisone. A broad [immunosuppressant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2533778/), prednisone works by disabling the production of pro-inflammatory molecules that are crucial for the body to mount an immune defense. So while prednisone‚Äîand drugs like it‚Äîare adept at quickly snuffing out inflammation, they leave the body vulnerable to any bug it encounters, and they can come with toxic side effects.

‚ÄúSimply stopping inflammation is not enough to return tissue to its normal state,‚Äù says [Ruslan Medzhitov](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ruslan_medzhitov/), a professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. This approach ignores the other side of the inflammation coin: resolution. Resolving inflammation is an active, highly choreographed process for rebuilding tissue and removing the dead bacteria and cells. When that process is disrupted, inflammatory diseases arise.

[In the early 2000s](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,993419-2,00.html) researchers began to recognize the role of inflammation in conditions as varied as [Alzheimer‚Äôs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887148/), [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803035/), [diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087185/), and [heart disease](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.0000129535.04194.38), prompting them to recast inflammation as the unifying explanation for a myriad of ailments, including those we develop as we age. Even aging itself, and its associated pathologies, is [driven by persistent inflammation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-018-0059-4).

‚ÄúUntil relatively recently, we believed that inflammation just stopped,‚Äù says Molly Gilligan, an internal medicine resident at Columbia University who studies how the immune system impacts cancer development. Immunologists thought that products of inflammation‚Äîmolecules that trigger it and dead cells and tissue‚Äîare eventually metabolized, or spontaneously dissipate on their own.

The reality is more complicated, and recognizing that could have game-changing effects on how we treat a wide swath of diseases.

**Why is inflammation dangerous?** 

Inflammation evolved to serve an important function: It rids our bodies of stuff that doesn‚Äôt belong, including foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, tumor cells, and irritants like splinters.

‚ÄúA classic example of inflammatory onset is the bee sting‚Äîthe site becomes hot, red, swollen, and painful,‚Äù says [Derek Gilroy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/inflammation-tissue-repair-fibrosis/academic-experts/gilroy-derek), a professor of immunology at University College London. This response comes from a series of biological changes: blood vessels dilate to deliver white blood cells to the site of injury, making tissues turn red. Fluid also floods the site, causing swelling. The molecules that trigger these vascular transformations precipitate the itching, pain, and fever associated with inflammation.

White blood cells, the body‚Äôs first responders, then swarm and kill the invaders. Under normal circumstances, this carnage is contained, with the initial inflammatory response subsiding within 24 to 48 hours.

When inflammation becomes chronic, though, the chemical weapons deployed by front-line immune cells often damage healthy tissue, and our bodies become collateral damage. The price exacted includes [worn joints](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/chronic-inflammation-and-your-joints), [damaged neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214864/), [scarred kidneys](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25662331/), and more. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, characterized by pain and worsening disability, have long been associated with persistent inflammation.

In extreme cases, such as the cytokine storms associated with sepsis or severe COVID-19, inflammation can [destroy and disable multiple organs](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01446/full), leading to catastrophic system failure and death.

**What happens after inflammation?**

Medzhitov likens an infection to a broken pipe that has flooded an office with water. Fixing the pipe might stop water from streaming in, but it doesn‚Äôt restore the office to its previous, functional state. Similarly, inflammation has a clean-up phase known as resolution, and it proceeds in a series of highly coordinated steps.

Like inflammation‚Äôs onset, its resolution is orchestrated by an army of signaling molecules. Among the most intensely studied are the specialized pro-resolving mediators, or SPMs, which were [discovered](https://rupress.org/jem/article/183/1/137/58333/Lipoxin-A4-and-B4-are-potent-stimuli-for-human) [in the 1990s](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/1578) by [Charles Serhan](https://serhanlab.bwh.harvard.edu/), a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. Serhan was inspired by his postdoctoral mentor, [Bengt Samuelsson](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1982/samuelsson/facts/), who uncovered how fatty molecules called lipids trigger inflammation. Serhan was searching for similar molecules when he identified lipoxin. But to his surprise, rather than inciting inflammation, lipoxin seemed to hamper it.

Over the next several years, Serhan and his colleagues identified additional SPMs. These molecules are derived from essential fatty acids such as those omega-3s famously found in cold-water fish like salmon and sardines. But they are difficult to study in the lab. ‚ÄúOne of the main challenges is that they have short half-lives, so the body metabolizes them very quickly,‚Äù Gilligan says. Because of this, researchers who work on them often turn to synthetic versions of the molecules, or mimetics, which are simpler, more stable, and cheaper to produce.

[Catherine Godson](https://people.ucd.ie/catherine.godson), a professor of molecular medicine at University College Dublin, has long been interested in diabetes, given its impact on global public health as the most common cause of kidney failure. When she learned of SPMs, she was excited by the idea of encouraging resolution to treat diabetics, a ‚Äúpopulation with a particularly high risk for infection.‚Äù

In [mice with diabetic kidney disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X21003586?via=ihub), scarring from kidney inflammation gradually destroys the organ. Her team is testing the therapeutic potential of a lipoxin mimetic in these and other animal models. They‚Äôve also looked at the mimetic‚Äôs effect in [human tissue ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30213823/)in lab cell cultures taken from patients with atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the blood vessel wall. In both cases, inflammatory factors plummeted when the mimetic was introduced; for the mice, the kidneys recovered their function in a stunning reversal of established disease.

Gilroy notes, however, that the story on SPMs is incomplete. ‚ÄúWhile lipoxins are present at levels in the body that indicate that they‚Äôre important in resolution, other SPMs such as resolvins require more evaluation,‚Äù he says.

**Manipulating macrophages**

Scientists speculate that one way lipoxins and other pro-resolution molecules work is by interacting with immune cells called macrophages.

Because they‚Äôre so abundant during inflammation, macrophages have traditionally been thought of as pro-inflammatory cells, says [Gerhard Kr√∂nke](https://www.sfb1181.forschung.fau.eu/person/prof-dr-gerhard-kronke/), an immunologist and rheumatologist at the University of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. ‚ÄúBut a paradigm shift in the last decade or so suggests that macrophages are pivotal players in the resolution of inflammation.‚Äù

Gilroy agrees, calling macrophages ‚Äúlinchpin cells at the juxtaposition of inflammation and resolution: It can go one way if we‚Äôre healthy and the other way if we‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Initially, when the danger posed by invaders is at its peak, the macrophages drawn to the area are inflammatory‚Äîsecreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and amping up production of antimicrobial agents. But this balance shifts as the tide of the confrontation turns. After the number of viruses declines, the debris left behind‚Äîviral remnants, dead immune cells, and other waste‚Äîmust be collected and cleared away before it sparks another cycle of inflammation. That‚Äôs when the macrophages switch gears.

Attracted by ‚Äúeat me‚Äù signals expressed on the surface of dying cells, macrophages readily engulf and clear cellular corpses from the environment. But it‚Äôs not just about clearing the wreckage‚Äîthis act also flips a genetic switch, reprogramming macrophages to restore balance to the system and heal the tissues.

‚ÄúMacrophages start to produce factors that tell the local tissue, Don‚Äôt recruit any more inflammatory cells here, or, Let‚Äôs proliferate and start repairs there,‚Äù says [Kodi Ravichandran](https://pathology.wustl.edu/people/kodi-ravichandran-bvsc-phd/), an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis whose research focuses on [how dead cells are cleared](https://rupress.org/jem/article/207/9/1807/40966/Find-me-and-eat-me-signals-in-apoptotic-cell) from the body.

**Clearing away cellular debris** 

Now consensus is building that many of the illnesses attributed to inflammation‚Äîboth chronic and acute‚Äîcan be traced to a failure in resolution. Often that translates into a failure to clear away dead cells.

‚ÄúIf you knock out receptors in the [macrophages of mice](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/4/1261) that recognize dying cells, for example, they become incapable of eating up these cells, resulting in a lupus-like disease,‚Äù with symptoms such as arthritis and skin rash, says *Kr√∂nke.* 

A similar mechanism is at work in older people, says Gilroy. As we age, the body loses a protein that recognizes dying cells; this blocks macrophages‚Äô ability to find and eat debris. Locked in a pro-inflammatory state, these macrophages continue to produce molecules that amplify the inflammatory response early on.

Perhaps COVID-19 has been more severe in older populations ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôve lost some of the pro-resolution pathways with age,‚Äù suggests [Luke O‚ÄôNeill](https://www.tcd.ie/Biochemistry/people/laoneill/), an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin. He notes that COVID-19 has also been problematic for people with genetic differences that impact immune function, resulting in overactive inflammatory responses or underactive pro-resolving ones. His group and others [have demonstrated](https://academic.oup.com/immunotherapyadv/article/1/1/ltab013/6291349) that macrophages primed for inflammatory action play a significant role in critical COVID-19 cases, and they are currently testing pro-resolving strategies to combat this effect.

Cancer‚Äôs course, too, is affected when inflammation fails to resolve. The soup of toxins, growth factors, and other inflammatory by-products that accompany inflammation spurs cancer‚Äôs growth and spread. Many conventional treatments end up exacerbating the problem, according to [Dipak Panigrahy](https://www.bidmc.org/research/research-by-department/pathology/laboratories/dipak-panigrahy-lab), an assistant professor of pathology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

‚ÄúChemotherapy and radiation are like sledgehammers,‚Äù Panigrahy says. ‚ÄúThey may kill the tumor, but the debris they create stimulates inflammation, which feeds circulating tumor cells that survive the treatment.‚Äù

A decade ago, Panigrahy was puzzling over this conundrum when he met Serhan at a conference on lipids in Canc√∫n, Mexico. ‚ÄúI had just presented my research on cell death in cancer and how there‚Äôs no way to clear the resulting debris when I heard Serhan‚Äôs talk about how he discovered these lipids that eliminated debris,‚Äù he says. The two Boston-based researchers have shared a close collaboration ever since.

In proof-of-concept [experiments](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/127282) conducted on mice, Panigrahy‚Äôs group was able to prevent tumors from recurring after surgery by dosing the animals with mimetics of resolvin, one of the pro-resolving mediators discovered in Serhan‚Äôs lab. Phase one clinical trials for pancreatic, brain, and colon cancers will begin this year, says Panigrahy.

**Long COVID and inflammation**

Although much work remains to decode its secrets, ‚Äúlong COVID likely results from a catastrophic failure of appropriate immune response and resolution,‚Äù Gilroy suggests.

Meg St. Esprit is part of a large cohort of COVID-19 survivors who continue to suffer symptoms months after the virus has passed. She and her family contracted the disease in November 2020, and for seven days the mother of four in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was beset by a high fever and severe headaches. Debilitating fatigue, vertigo, and brain fog soon followed. But while her husband and children recovered, St. Esprit‚Äôs symptoms lingered, and new ones emerged.

Since her bout with COVID-19, she has developed blood clots and myocarditis‚Äîdangerous consequences of inflammation. It‚Äôs also as if her entire body has gone haywire. ‚ÄúDifferent parts of it regularly flare up now,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMy thumb joints swell to twice their normal size, my knee puffs out like a grapefruit, and I‚Äôve had hives more times than I can count.‚Äù

Drugs to tweak the natural inflammatory process would thus be a powerful tool in our arsenal for long COVID as well. Even now the [hunt is on](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2016.39). O‚ÄôNeill and colleagues, for example, are testing molecules in clinical trials that push macrophages to be pro-resolving. SPMs are being tested extensively in animal models of diseases like cancer and sepsis, and more modestly in small patient trials studying [eczema](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22834636/) and [periodontal disease](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.704163/full).

But Gilroy cautions that the answer may be more nuanced than anti-inflammatory versus pro-resolution, and that drugs targeting both approaches may be needed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like driving a car at full speed,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn order to stop, you take your foot off the accelerator, which would be like dampening inflammation‚Äôs onset. And then you apply the brakes, or in other words, promote its resolution.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/tbuax0/treatment_for_inflammation_found_this_article/,1647017336.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

This last year I got Crohn's Disease. I've now been to hospital and doctors visits the last 6 months. So far my health insurance has covered all costs which has been well above $200,000 so far.

The health insurance is called Wellpoint. In a years time my medical costs should be between $500,000 to a million in costs.

I'm currently labeled as unemployed and work as my mom's unpaid caregiver who suffers from Dementia.

Very financially stable we could live off savings for a few years with no monthly income.

I best guess is due to me being unemployed and the seriousness of the disease is the reason I have no out of pocket costs.

I'm just curious on anyone thoughts and opinions. I could contact Wellpoint, but I figure why as questions as long as my healthcare is free.

During this time I started a new job. I became a keyholder. While I had some new responsibilities that I was adjusting to, I did some really stupid things and its very much unlike myself. 

During the first week of the job, I had left the cash bag from my till with cash in it out in the open (obviously a big no no) twice. Not once. Twice. Boss talked to me about it the first time, so I knew I screwed up.. then proceeded to do it again. Literally had no idea I did it. Since it happened twice it had to go to HR, and they decided to keep me. I was shocked. Huge LP issue.. 

Through out the next month, I did similar things again, and the straw that broke the camels back was entering the wrong amount in the debit machine. Customers order was 87.16. I typed in 8.71. Boss told me I could either quit or risk being fired for another LP issues.. i am normally so diligent and not that forgetful that that would happen once let alone twice. 

I read about memory loss and prendisone, and I have become way more absent minded since I started taken it.. Do you think its possible? Or am I just crazy?? I feel like since taking these meds my memory has become so foggy..

1lmqsq0,CrohnsDisease,"""Tomorrow, I will be that positive, joyful dad.‚Äù","I sit in the quiet afternoon light, the familiar heaviness of Crohn‚Äôs pressing down on me. My body feels fraught with battles fought silently for years‚Äîa constant, gnawing reminder of a war waged within. Today, that relentless pain is unyielding, and I am overcome with a deep grief, a mixture of physical torment and an aching sense of loss for the dreams of daytime ease.

Across the room, my daughter beams at me with pure, unadulterated joy. In her bright eyes is the reflection of a world untouched by my struggles‚Äîa world I long to keep safe for her. She is a picture of innocence, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing inside me. I yearn every day for her to see me as the fun, engaging, ever-present dad. I want to be the source of adventure and happiness in her life‚Äîa souce of positivity, filled with energy and love.

And yet, here I am, a man burdened by layers of pain and moments of self-pity. The internal conflict is fierce: each day is a battle to hide the throbbing ache, to stave off the despair that creeps in with every flare-up. Today, as I sit here, I feel stranded between the desire to be her rock and the crushing weight of my own exhaustion. The invisible scars and relentless pain have me at a moment where self-doubt and sorrow eclipse the hope I want to pass on.

In fleeting seconds, I catch myself glancing at her‚Äîa fleeting spark reminds me of the strength I still carry. Even though today is marked by despair, it is also a reminder of the love that fuels my journey. It is the fierce hope that despite these dark, tiring days, there is a better tomorrow waiting to be embraced. I clench my hands, trying to hold onto that belief as tightly as I hold onto the memory of brighter days when my laughter was the loudest sound in our home.

In this raw moment of vulnerability, I understand that being a dad is not about projecting endless happiness. It‚Äôs about the courage to stand by her, even on days when the pain is overwhelming, and to show her that it‚Äôs okay to feel every emotion deeply‚Äîeven the sorrow. I wish for her to learn that life is woven with both light and dark, and that sometimes, our strength lies in our willingness to acknowledge the struggle and still move forward.

Even as exhaustion tests my resolve and the pain resurfaces like an unwelcome guest, I remind myself that hope and love, though sometimes hidden, are never truly lost. And within this battle, I find a fragment of determination‚Äîa spark that whispers, ‚ÄúTomorrow, I will be that positive, joyful dad.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1lmqsq0/tomorrow_i_will_be_that_positive_joyful_dad/,1751127700.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1kbht0k,CrohnsDisease,Need to vent about my Ostomy Bag,"Hi, I'm 21 years old, still living with my parents and I've been diagnosed with Crohn's for 12 years now, and it's been a super fun journey. I've switched to so many different biologics throughout the years, I've had plenty of flare ups and few periods of remission, but that's not the point. 

Around February I started feeling sick, like throwing up and loss of appetite. I'd feel a little better after a few days and would try eating again, and sometimes it'd stay down, but a lot of times I'd just ended up throwing up again. I probably should've figured something was *really* wrong with me when Zofran wasn't working, but whatever, I may be a little stupid. 

Anyways, eventually we go to the hospital because no medications or anything are helping, and I'd definitely be in better hands there. Turns out I have a blockage in my intestines, so the plan is do an ostomy surgery to let my body heal and so I can get the nutrients I need through food without having to worry about throwing up or affecting my bowel movements.

I've had an ostomy bag before, wayyy back when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's when I was around 8-9 years old, my memory is getting a little foggy with those early years, but I don't remember the bag being a huge problem in my life. All I could remember is how much I hated the bag changing process, poor young me had a very low pain tolerance...

The ostomy bag this time around, while it does feel just a bit challenging to deal with this time, it could maybe be that I'm older and just more aware of what's happening, but besides that, everything's been going swimmingly! Haven't had to excessively wipe to the point it irritates my skin thanks to the bag, and I've been enjoying all sorts of foods I haven't had in a very long time due to restricted diets I've been put on... The main problem I've been having started about a few weeks ago. 

I went out of town with my parents about 2 weeks ago for Spring Break, and my mom changed my bag while we were out there. (Mom does the bag changing because I'm too much of a wuss to do it myself... Go Mom!!!) A little bit of the tape on the ostomy bag was loose, but it was no big deal, as long as the ring seal stays on! Well, the next morning I wake up, and surprise! The tape came loose on one side and it leaked in my sleep! So much fun! One clean-up and bag replacement later, we end up taping the surrounding area down with medical tape, just to make sure the bag REALLY stays down, and it worked! No problems, no leaking for the rest of the trip and back home...

So yesterday it was about time to change the bag again, so we go through that whole song and dance, and I really press down on the ostomy bag tape to make sure it's sealed, but we put just a little bit of extra tape on it just to be safe. Everything was fine, nothing was wrong until 3 hours ago as of writing this... The ostomy bag went loose, AGAIN! I don't even know how this happened, when it happened out of town, we were in a more dryer area, so maybe the dryness of my skin made it hard for everything to stick? But back home it should be no problem, so why did it happen again?! We cleaned everything up and replace the bag AGAIN, and we did what we did last time and just surrounded the whole area with tape. Really hope it works because I'm getting tired of this.

It's not really a super concerning problem, like everything else with my bag has been going fine besides this occasional hiccup. But this time around, I just feel so frustrated having to deal with this again. I don't even know how this happens because as far as I know, we've been doing everything right... And just looking at my bedsheets and pajamas with leaked crap over it, it just makes me feel gross. Crohn's in general is a pretty gross condition to have, but this really takes the cake... All my poop is coming out of my stomach instead of my butt, and it's all getting collected in this bag. I don't know, I just feel kinda sad about all this. You'd think after 12 years I'd be used to this and I wouldn't care, but my issues still manage to get to me sometimes...

Sorry this was such a long read, I tend to ramble on a lot, especially when it's something pissing me off. If you did read through this whole thing, I appreciate it. I needed to let off some steam, and this seemed like a good place to tell my tale... I don't have any friends or families who have Crohn's, or have it as bad as me, so no one would understand all the frustration, I'm sure there's people here who've had ostomy bags, temporary or permanent who'd feel me... Once again, thanks for reading my ranting, and hope you all have a good day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1kbht0k/need_to_vent_about_my_ostomy_bag/,1746023077.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1c0o63q,Alzheimers,Seeking advice : I am in the wrong to walk away from my mum. ,"So long story short my mum has had signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs for many years, I was in my mid teens when it begun . I am now 19 and she‚Äôs been official diagnosis which I am glad. Here the issues begin last year I was supposed to go to university but I didnt  I took a gap year and would look after my mum till she got diagnosed and have replanned to go this summer so the past  year I looked after my mum day in day out, put up with her insults, got her out the house and just dealt with her while my sister would ignore her issue  although she lives at home and just go on with her life, my dad works away. 

I haven‚Äôt had any sort of social life since last summer as my mum can‚Äôt be alone without freaking out so it‚Äôs harmed me growing me and left me with no social life  now on I been diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs disease it‚Äôs been a lot of pain, suffering and loneliness. The day my mum was diagnosed my family were already to change but nothing has, they have no interest in looking after her, doing house chores/ helping out it‚Äôs just the same situation which makes me a slave she gets worse by the week she used to get upset because she could do things wrong or couldn‚Äôt remember but now she‚Äôs just the angry person who is incapable of doing anything meaning only more tasks and chores are on me. If I don‚Äôt make food she won‚Äôt eat, no cleaning gets done and animals are neglected. 

.The biggest issue of all is my relationship with my mum is died, she hates my guts, she will insult me or  hit me if I make a simple comment or question that she finds offensive. Overall she‚Äôs just a awful person now and I can‚Äôt stand her, her doctor made it clear her staying at home doing nothing is practically killing her I can‚Äôt get her out the house because of our bad relationship and my family won‚Äôt push her to do anything aka she gets to sit and watch tv all day. They won‚Äôt take her out the house because it‚Äôs always just to much for her even food shopping is apparently to stressful for her to do. 


 I know the disease is what changed her but she‚Äôs generally awful to me I loved my mum as a kid but now she like the monster I live with because I don‚Äôt recognise her, she can‚Äôt live without me,  she relays on me but she can‚Äôt tolerate me speaking to her. I threatened to leave home in summer if she continued doing nothing, she didn‚Äôt care and while I tried to get through to her she ignored me and watched her tv, she‚Äôs used to volunteer at a charity shop as she‚Äôs still esrly stages so still has independence it was only a few days a week to get out the house but she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt like the change of people so she quit and none of the family have pushed her to go back and see.  

I spoken to my family about things needs to changed but it‚Äôs a waste of time but been lectured about how she won‚Äôt always be here and we need to make a effort while no one makes a effort to help her or me . I really have tried everything to stay but as it stands I want to move away to university and never see my mum again, as I seen things I put my life on hold far to long for someone who now hates me, I missed out on so much and wasted so much time I want to get out and enjoy my life without having to deal with my mother ever again.  I know it sounds horrible but I hoping someone else in this group can understand my pain and angry coping with this disease. I am in the wrong to just walk away and give up on helping her ?

1bhjhdx,Alzheimers,My biggest fear and I have a higher chance of getting it.,"Memory loss / Alzheimer‚Äôs has always been my biggest fear in life. Last year I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, an autoimmune disease. Just this weekend my grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs. The grief of her having it and how this will affect my mom, who already is not doing great in the mental health department, have been top of mind. But I‚Äôm also freaking out about my chances of getting it now since I have family history. I just looked it up and turns out there was a study that suggests that people admitted to a hospital for an autoimmune disease are 20 percent more likely to be admitted with dementia later on. 

Is there anything I can do? I‚Äôm a 27 year old woman. I manage my ulcerative colitis with medication and regularly see a GI specialist. I lift weights and do cardio. I don‚Äôt smoke and rarely drink alcohol / planning to cut it out entirely now. Already these past couple years I‚Äôve noticed a difficult time remembering specific words that I feel like I should be able to recall right away. I‚Äôm terrified.

1g28vx3,Alzheimers,"early symptoms? paranoia, suspiciousness, anxiety rather than memory issues?","I live with my mother (age 82) and my daughter (age 21) in a house I own. I invited my mother to live with me when her husband needed to go into assisted living. It is helpful to both of us financially and we generally enjoy each other's company. My daughter is attending a commuter college so it made sense for her to live here too.

I am wondering if my mom is just mean or if she might be showing early signs of Alzheimer's. 

My mother doesn't treat my daughter well. She is very critical of her, and makes mean comments about her eating. She thinks she eats too much and has made comments about my daughter eating her food. She also thinks my daughter is taking her things like her favorite knife from the kitchen. She told me she thinks ""someone"" is taking her stuff. She labeled her plastic measuring cups with GMA (which is what my daughter calls her -- Gma for Grandma), I think because she is worried about my daughter taking them. 

My mother's sister, my aunt, died in her mid-seventies of dementia / Alzheimer's. For years, maybe decades, before her obvious decline my aunt was paranoid and suspicious. She accused my mother of taking jewelry and money from their mother. We didn't know my aunt had dementia. It only became obvious in retrospect when the dementia progressed. My mother thought that her sister was a terrible person but it turned out she had Alzheimer's (or some other sort of dementia). I don't recall we saw a lot of memory problems as indications that she was dealing with that. 

Now I wonder if what I'm observing is just a mean person or the start of dementia. My mom is so nice to me and so mean to my daughter. It breaks my heart.

Has anyone had experience with early Alzheimer's showing up as suspiciousness and meanness rather than memory issues? My mom also has a lot of anxiety, increasing all the time. I feel like I'm constantly having to do things to help her be less anxious. I haven't noticed many memory issues though, other than she tells me things she's already told me before.

We‚Äôve had issues largely under control through a combination of fluoxetine and buspirone, but over the last several months her anxiety has really ratcheted up. Most days she can‚Äôt even sit through a tv show because she‚Äôs too agitated. 

I spoke with her geriatrician about it and let him know it‚Äôs getting out of control. I suspected he would suggest Ativan, but he‚Äôs hesitant to prescribe anything because she‚Äôs already on 2 medications. He referred her for therapy instead. I felt defeated, but was willing to give it a shot. The therapist said she‚Äôs not a good candidate for talk therapy (she‚Äôs not really with it enough to stay fully engaged) and suggested some anxiety exercises (box breathing, taking walks, etc). 

Not only do we already utilize the tools she sent along, but I work full time and I‚Äôm in school. I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to hold her hand through every panic attack and we don‚Äôt have the funds to hire someone to come sit with her. 

Then yesterday I read that even if the doc does wind up prescribing Ativan, it‚Äôs much more likely that she‚Äôll fall. She had a horrible fall last year and her balance is only decreasing so Ativan probably won‚Äôt even be an option.

She somehow made it back to the out skirts of the city after travelling 200+ km away and ran out of gas. She parked in a construction zone. 3 people looking for her blew right past her because why would they be looking for her in a construction zone. 

A stranger helped her call her cousin ‚Äî who is actively fighting us in a custody case for our little guy right now (6). It‚Äôs very complicated. 

My mom called me. Wailing. I‚Äôve never heard someone make noises like that. I‚Äôm away right now (about 7hrs) for work this summer. She was sobbing telling me when I come back I‚Äôll see she has nothing. She was screaming that my dad is having an affair with someone at work and she ‚Äújust knows‚Äù. She was screaming she was going to rip her hair out and said she wanted to kill my dad. Apparently she had gotten out of the car and was telling construction workers this. 

My dad drives a very distinct truck so when he passed her in the construction zone she screamed that he drove right past her and hopes she ran away and died. She cried and wailed that we are taking all her money and cutting her off from the world. Trying to take her phone and the wifi. 

I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt kill someone with her car. 

I‚Äôve never in my life heard someone scream like that. 

This is the first time we have ever experienced this. I had to talk my sister down from a panic attack on the phone. 

I screamed at my dad on the phone because he has a hard time understanding that just telling someone with Alzheimer‚Äôs that they are miss remembering etc doesn‚Äôt work. 

She eventually decided to get in the car with him. When she got home she was completely fine. Did not even Acknowledge she was missing for 8hours. She had tried to rip the peonies out of our front lawn. They were from my dad‚Äôs grandma and he maintains them because my mom loves peonies. 

My mom used to be the most loving. Caring person in the world. In moments of clarity she will cry to me about how much she loves my dad and is sorry she is becoming a burden to him. 

I miss her so much. 

Her insecurities are becoming delusions and I don‚Äôt know what to do. No she does not have a UTI. 

I got offered a dream role in my field here and I am heart broken I can‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôm heart broken I can‚Äôt call my mom and talk about it. I can‚Äôt tell her anything beyond surface level. She just worries and freaks out. 

I might have to come home early. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know if there is anything anyone could say about this. I just needed to tell someone who might understand. My friends are amazing and helped look for my mom. But they don‚Äôt get it. They won‚Äôt get it. And that‚Äôs okay.

So my Dad (70) is having daily panic attacks now where his heart rate hits about 140 bpm. Is this amount of anxiety normal? I get the feeling he's going to have a heart attack if it continues. He's constantly worrying. All he wants to do is see his mother who died 8 years ago.

1j9zlmq,Alzheimers,Advice on what to tell LO when placing them in memory care,"Hello everyone, 

I won't go into too much detail but my mother has Alzheimer's. I tried to let my mother live independently for as long as possible, but last month I knew she could no longer do so. I've been with her every day for the past month. Recent visit with neurologist confirmed that she requires 24/7 supervision. I am placing her in memory care near my home at the end of this week. It is about 50 miles away from where she currently lives. I've been trying to make the last days in her home of 30+ years as nice as I can. I have been telling my mother that she has cerebrovascular disease and that the blood flow to her brain is not so good and that's why she forgets to eat, can't figure out how to put on clothes, and gets lost going to the bathroom. 



I decided against telling my mother her real diagnosis because she watched her mother become a different person from Alzheimer's, and my father withered away from frontotemporal dementia. It is her worst fear. Telling her wouldn't do any good.



The heartbreaking thing is that my mom knows her brain function is declining. She spent this morning crying with me that she's scared of losing herself. She is going to hate being placed in memory care but it is the best thing for her safety. 



There is so much about Alzheimer's and dementia I don't understand. She remembers me, can carry on full conversations, and retain memories of recent conversations we've had, but thinks she has to walk downstairs going backwards because she walked upstairs going forward, has daily panic attacks, and thinks the trash bin talks to her. I decided not to tell her that she is going to be in memory care until we are at the facility. If I told her beforehand she would resist. That being said, when placing a ""higher functioning"" LO with dementia/Alzheimer's, what did you tell them when you brought them to memory care?

1h9zhlr,Alzheimers,Grandpa asked Grandma who she was yesterday morning and I think I'm breaking.,"My grandpa's memory has gone very quickly and it seems like it's escalating. He was hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism about a month ago. He still knew my name. Grandma did tell me he always asks who I am after I leave, but he can still associate my face with my name. 

On Thanksgiving we all came over. My brother lives in a different town so he doesn't come down much. Grandpa still knew my name but I don't think he remembered my brother. When they were talking, my grandma walked by and grandpa told my brother ""that's my wife you know."" But he still said my name when we left and said goodbye. 

I've been going through a horrible wave of anxiety that I'm currently booking appointments for so I'm feeling a little mentally broken as it is. I've been away because of that the last week. My panic attacks usually send me into a tailspin of weight loss, fatigue, and misery and that can last weeks. 

My mom texted me yesterday and told me that in the morning, grandpa didn't know who grandma was. Because of where I'm at mentally right now, it didn't really hit me. 

Today was a better day in terms of anxiety. I felt close to normal all day. I was preparing dinner for me and my wife about an hour ago and let her know that he didn't recognize grandma. Then went right into a panic attack. It's finally hitting me and I think saying it out loud kind of sent me spinning. I'm bad, very very bad, at dealing with life's difficulties and tend to withdraw.

Aside from the dementia and PE, grandpa also has cancer. I have no idea how long we have with him. And the time we do have is not really with him in a sense. All of those wonderful hunting and fishing trips, all the things he taught me, all the time we spent together. I don't think he really remembers much of it. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess maybe I need to put it out there. I just really feel lost and even though he's still here I know time is running out. I've been lucky and never really experienced this kind of loss before and I have no idea how to process any of my emotions right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1h9zhlr/grandpa_asked_grandma_who_she_was_yesterday/,1733711339.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1glptb7,Alzheimers,Short term tricks and tips,"My grandfather passed away unexpectedly last Friday. He was the caretaker for my grandmother who has Alzheimer‚Äôs and dementia. He was, let‚Äôs say difficult to be respectful. He would not allow us to step in and blocked every attempt at getting help or making smart choices for her. 

Now we have her, a funeral and 1000 arrangements that we need to sort because he cashed out his life insurance and for some god awful reason took the will out of the safe. I live across the country and thankfully have a job that has allows me to fly home for a week to help out. When we got her to my mom it became clear she was far more advanced then he let us know. Like can not be left alone, at all.  I seem to be the only one that can calm her down. Probably because I‚Äôm the only one that has gone to therapy and worked relentlessly to undo the trauma we grew up with (the reason I live so far). So I‚Äôm calmer and more patient. Because of this, I decided that she should stay with myself and my 9 year old daughter in a hotel for the week so I can keep an eye on her while we all get things together. 

It has been possibly the hardest week of my life. I have to leave Friday to go back home and I‚Äôm terrified that leaving my mom with the responsibility of her care and all of this crap is going to give my mom another stroke. 

To make it worse she actually gets violent with my mom, hitting her throwing boxes at her. It‚Äôs terrible. We are going thought the motions of getting her into long term care. But we don‚Äôt have the money so we have to navigate the slow shitty process that is Medicare. 

Any tips tricks or advice on some on our biggest challenges would be so helpful. 

Getting up in the night, she gets into things and gets confused. My mom has a one floor house thankfully but she has dogs and is a borderline hoarder so having her up into things is super dangerous. 

She gets confused and violent the topics right now:

-She thinks people are stealing her yarn I got her yarn it didn‚Äôt help. She will get up and pull apart all of the luggage trying to find it. 
-She wants her dog (she does have one but we can‚Äôt take him and have to find a home for him). She also thinks she has two more that do not exist. 
-she wants to see her mom/sister/aunt that have been dead for 40+ years. 
-she wants to go back to her childhood home 10 hours away. 

I‚Äôm thankfully able to pull her out of it every time before it gets bad. But if I‚Äôm not around she is awful. *She yelled at my daughter and called her a bitch. She hit my dad and threw a box at my mom‚Äôs head. I‚Äôm so afraid to leave tomorrow.

My grandfather was verbally abusive and would call my mom while yelling at my grandmother and say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling your daughter right now and she is going to call the police and have you thrown into a home‚Äù. I think because of this when my grandmother sundowns she gets so violent with my poor mom. 

I have a sister but she is very emotionally unstable and has been kinda shitty and honestly I think is just going to cause more stress. 

Also any advice on helping my daughter with this. 
My little is devastated. Before this she only ever saw grandma on good days and my grandmother adored her. The flipping switch sent my baby girl into a straight panic attack last night. 

Is there anything we can do short term to help make this easier. Medication, THC, lifelike stuffed dog, door locks? Any advice would be a godsend. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1glptb7/short_term_tricks_and_tips/,1730984271.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
1czn9zd,Alzheimers,ALZ and Technology,"So my mom was diagnosed with (about) Stage 2 ALZ a year ago. She still has a lot of her long term, and even short term memory, but it's that middle area where she is a total loss. She's got about half an hour, and then things just fade.

The fascinating part to me is that I work in IT, and I regularly help teachers with their work in the classroom. Many of them are still luddites to say the least. But working in edtech, it's really amazing to watch some of them juggle so much, and our tech - from LMS tools to Google - are a tremendous help. 

I can't help but think that it would help my mom as well. 

She's a boomer, so tech is mostly a mystery, but the biggest frustrations we have with her revolve around her inability to just... scroll UP on her gorram phone. We'll help her with an anxious moment, and then half an hour later, it'll just occur to her again. She's pretty good about taking meds, taking care of herself, and even driving, but she'll have a panic attack about a SPAM Email, message us, we'll respond, and then she'll message us again about the same thing half an hour later. A little while ago, our response to one continual question was just SCROLL UP, MOM.

I'm actually a bit comforted - because if I end up having memory issues, I was raised with tech to the point where I'll have little trouble handing my brain over to the Google. I wish my mom could just do that - at least to a degree - so that she could supplement her memory better.

Has anyone had any luck getting their folks to embrace their phones and tablets to the point where it can supplement their memories?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1czn9zd/alz_and_technology/,1716564059.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1fut2is,Alzheimers,Does this sound like Alzheimer‚Äôs?,"I think my mom, who is 71, likely has early (or moderate?) Alzheimer‚Äôs and my father (65) is in denial. She‚Äôs always been a spacey person but over the past 5 years her concerning behavior has progressed. 

Her drinking is also an issue. I‚Äôve had to babysit her at a wedding, birthday party, etc. hosted by my in-laws after she had too many drinks (she also takes an antidepressant so that likely intensifies the alcohol‚Äôs effects). And she caused a scene (it‚Äôs too humiliating to recount) infront of 6 of my best friends after my baby shower. She also gave me a panic attack the morning of my wedding because she ‚Äúcouldnt find‚Äù (forgot) a photo of my dad‚Äôs deceased mom for the memorial table. For context, my mom has a lot of emotional issues from her childhood and young adulthood, and my father is an emotionally abusive presence in her life. I‚Äôm an only child but my husband has witnessed nearly all of this behavior as we‚Äôve been together since 2016. Many times after she‚Äôs had some drinks or had a hit of weed, she will get very emotional and cry on me.

Sidenote: my father is likely bipolar (undiagnosed) and would never go to therapy. He is a very angry little italian dude with a helluva temper. Like, can pop your fucking ears off if he is having a meltdown OR can give you the silent treatment for 2 weeks. I‚Äôve never seen him take accountability or apologize for any of the emotional terror he‚Äôs responsible for causing in my (and my mom‚Äôs) life. 4 years ago, when my mom was still herself, right after my grandmother‚Äôs death, my mom and I had a private conversation about how she thinks my dad is undiagnosed bipolar and how it is very difficult for her (and myself) to grieve my grandma‚Äôs death because every time we brought her up my dad had something negative to say or made it about him. 

Red flags:
- asked if my daughter will be sleeping on her changing table when she‚Äôd already seen her in the crib 15 minutes earlier.
- forgot about my cancer scare in 2021. I had precancer cells on my cervix and needed surgery to remove them before they spread. thankfully(!!!) nothing has popped up since, but my mother had no recollection of this.
- forgot my daughter‚Äôs middle name. my daughter is 7 months old and my parents are totally obsessed. they flew from FL to TN for her birth. she is their only grandkid and I‚Äôm their only child. my mom recently asked- ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs *daughter‚Äôs* middle name? is it May?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes, just like my middle name and your mom‚Äôs maiden name.‚Äù this incident is what prompted me to do more digging on Alzheimer‚Äôs because May is a family name and I‚Äôd always planned to give her that middle name.
- constantly forgets pieces of information that were just shared with her. but she still remembers like every movie star in every movie before 2000 (like brings up that stuff an excessive amount)
- has severe anxiety but also acts like the life of the party and gets super loud and outrageous/emotional and embarrassing at times in social settings
- she hates driving now and hasn‚Äôt driven on the highway in a few years 
- recently confronted my (only) aunt & uncle about a 40-year-old issue between them and my dead grandmother because my aunt & uncle, in the past few years, have talked badly about my grandma in the context of this issue. this came right as we were about to finally bury her ashes. my parents felt they needed to confront my aunt & uncle and ‚Äúforce them to apologize‚Äù before interring the ashes. it‚Äôs been 4 years since she died and they just did the confrontation 3 weeks ago. 
‚Äî> my parents have the ashes, so they have control, and have a lot of pent up anger toward my aunt & uncle // are exhibiting very bizarre behavior that comes off as not wanting my aunt present at my grandmother‚Äôs memorial service. 
‚Äî‚Äî> I think my mother is being influenced/controlled by my dad - it feels like he‚Äôs isolating her from her only family (other than me) and making her so angry and anxious all the time about an issue that does not need to be brought back up. I have also observed that my father has narcissistic behavior/tendencies and paranoia re: what other people might be saying or thinking about him/them.

Does this sound like Alzheimer‚Äôs? (I think I know the answer)

What is the best approach here to help my mother, who I care about deeply, taking into account my father‚Äôs potential reaction(s)? 

‚Äî> another layer: my dad‚Äôs mom, who he was close to, was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs and he had to take care of her for 10 years/watch her die from it (he was also an only child).

1h7fqtk,Alzheimers,How do you know if it's Alzheimers vs stress or ordinary memory issues like from ADHD? How does this start? ,"My dad is 65 and under immense stress - my mom is close to being permanetly disabled the rest of her life (she basically already is and refuses to help herself), my grandmother with dementia and COPD moved in with them 2 years ago and it's like taking care of another kid (his own words not mine - not being mean), his brother had a widow maker in front of him and my dad saved his life recently, and their dad is on end of life hospice care with his stepmom also on it, and my dad is the one left unraveling all of their estate, funeral, and legal planning because no one else will. I think this may be relevant which is why I'm sharing.

My dad has always been forgetful. I have some form of ADHD which my parents didn't believe in medicating so I never got treatment, and we assume it came from my dad who gets very hyperfixated on things, hates loud sounds, was always above his peers in school, showed some signs of development delays as a toddler (not speaking til I think he was 4 or 5, wouldn't let anyone touch him), but can't remember things to save his life. He's always losing things or forgetting something random. They've speculated he is ""on the spectrum"" to some extent since he was a kid but never got him treated or diagnosed, sharing because maybe it's relevant?

Recently he is having a bit of a crisis and is convinced this is no longer just normal forgetfulness, and he thinks he has aquired Alzheimers or even dementia suddenly. He's losing things within his room (setting phone down and has no memory of where he put it, lost where he sat his badge down at work, lost reading glasses). He's also doing things like leaving his wallet and phone at random places. To me this sounds like normal memory issues that anyone with ADHD can do, he's been doing these exact things his whole life but not to this frequency. Every time he's at my house he has to go buy 2-3 more pairs of readers because he just loses them. He forgot his license last month going to pick up a rental car. I know when I'm stressed, my ADHD ramps up and I do things like this alot. 

He's panicking right now thinking he's dying and trying to get into neurology, and he has 0 history of memory disease on his side that we know of. What does concern me though is he's also starting to do things like forgetting lock and safe codes as well as passwords he's had for years and years, this is where I've stopped thinking maybe it's not just whatever neurodivergent it is he maybe has but this is the start of something. Does this sound like the start, or more likely just immense stress and the quickly coming family death making him spiral?

1gww3lv,Alzheimers,Has anyone had experience with stopping Alzheimer‚Äôs medications and seen any improvements or decline? And any experience with moving stress ? ,"I (31f) have been the primary caregiver for my mother, early onset (61F) since 2020. I have one older brother but since my parents divorce in 2006 he never cared about my mom or prioritized spending time with her. I live 4 hours away and he‚Äôs always lived 25-30 min away yet he wouldn‚Äôt see her for months at a time. Thankfully I work remote so I am flexible to spend time with her at her home and try to go every other week. She lives alone as she is very strongly against having help and is in denial. (Trying to see how we can convince her if anyone has suggestions. Have 1 family friend who comes 3x a week to walk and distract her). When I‚Äôm not with her I spend hours on the phone or via video/ ring/ Alexa daily attempting to help her with medicines, feeding her cats, etc. I had been experiencing really bad caregiver burnout, stress, depression, isolation, all the fun stuff you name it these last years. 

This past summer my brother realized how bad it was and decided to finally try to help take care of her. He ended up moving her into his building abruptly so he could keep an eye on her daily. He‚Äôs always been anti-medicine and he always really pushed her not to be on any medications as he thinks it only makes things worse. He‚Äôs always been very into health but to a more extreme level of health and longevity than the average person. Once she moved and he was supposed to help take over, I learned later that he had her stop taking all her medications. Memantine, rivastagmine, and mirtazipine as her Neuro ones. The memantine we had started to taper down as they had maxed the dosage and the Neuro said we could taper it to see any noticeable changes. But the rivastigmine and mirtazipine were abruptly stopped. The move was very stressful for her as it was abrupt and she really didn‚Äôt want to leave her home. It was very traumatizing for her and she always hated moving. I told my brother we need to move slow and not do any abrupt changes but he doesn‚Äôt understand how Alzheimer‚Äôs works and he wanted to get everything done quick. 

I‚Äôve noticed a drastic change of cognitive decline the last month since the move however i can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs due to the stress of the move and new environment/ big changes or because of the stopping medications. I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. We been waiting to see a new neurologist and he can‚Äôt see her until February and haven‚Äôt been able to reach him. I don‚Äôt know if putting her back on her medicines will be even worse. She gets a lot more easily frustrated and irritated. Harder for her to communicate and find the right words. Doesn‚Äôt know which cat is which (her 2 cats are her life), how to feed them, how to shower on her own etc. Curious if anyone had any experience or advice with medications or moving stress?

1k2efoq,Alzheimers,Feeling Depressed,"My father was diagoned with Alzheimer's in 2021. Since then his memory has deteorated swiftly. We recently shifted him to a senior care facility where there is a care taker 24x7. I shifted him mainly because 
a) It was becoming increasingly difficult for my mom to take care of him.
b) The disease is affecting his physical traits now. His walking has becoming extremely slow, he is passing urine on the bed every night, running away from home in search of some place from his childhood days etc

It has been a month now since we shifted him there. In our recent visit, we saw that he has adjusted very well to the new place. The bittersweet moment is that not once does he mention he wants to go back to his own home. He only keeps praising the facility, how the caregiver is very polite etc. And in my mind, everytime he mentions something good about the facility - it breaks my heart a little as to how this disease affects families and takes away your very soul. 

For me and my mom, it will take sometime to adjust to the reality of not seeing dad at home. I will visit him every 1/2 weeks but still adjusting to this new reality. I also feel guilty sometimes as to should I have moved him into the facility. Maybe he would have loved to stay in his own home if he had not had the disease. Would want to hear from others who have gone through something similar.

1b9c5nd,Alzheimers,Decline After a Move - Depression?,"My grandmother was in assisted living with a steady decline in cognitive function over the last 7 months.

What concerns me is her emotional decline.  Currently she is staying in bed all day, won't go to activities, thinks nobody helps her, started not going to breakfast, talks about not caring about basically any portion of her day.  She is tired of not knowing anything and people asking her stuff.  

As her primary caretaker within our family, im not sure what I can do to help her.  With her current state, she doesn't remember that I visit her every other day.

1bb94k0,Alzheimers,"Newbie to all of this (confusion, fear, depression, and white hot anger)","I found out on Friday, after months of believing it was ""garden variety dementia,"" that my mother ""probably has Alzheimer's"" from her doctor. I understand that there really isn't a huge difference. At least I understand that from the point of view that dementia can mean a lot of memory/cognitive related problems, and that Alzheimer's is just one type of dementia. But in getting that news... that word... Alzheimer's... seems to have a heavier weight to it. 

I feel sunk... and more afraid. Before, I felt like I maybe understood how a diagnosis of dementia would affect her, but even reading all that I have over the weekend hasn't seemed to give me a better understanding of what to expect or when.

My dad passed away 20-years-ago from stage 4 lung cancer. It was pretty quick (9 months) from diagnosis to death. Near the end, he lost his mind because the cancer finally spread to his brain. Knowing people, things, whatever... it was nearly impossible, and it was sad when he didn't even recognize his own son (my only brother). üò¢ Eventually, he lapsed into a coma-like state, and was like that for the vast majority of his last three weeks on Earth. I imagine this is much like how it will end with my mother, but between now and then I don't know, and I fear what is to come.

Currently, she isn't too far, progressively, into Alzheimer's or any kind of dementia. She has problems relating concept A to concept B. She will repeat information to me, or ask the same questions many times over. She's had a few falls, which she claims were from tripping on a rug in her bathroom (not that I'm a true believer as that being the cause). Her finances are a mess, but she's also been entrusting a ""friend"" to help her pay her bills on time. He's doing a terrible job at making anything better for her other than just being on time. üôÑü´§üôÑü´§

The very worst part of this? My siblings (I'm #3 of 4 adult children) have nothing to do with my mom. I won't defend her behaviors in the past - she physically, mentally, and emotionally abused us as children. As adults she's been emotionally abusive, manipulative, and judgmental to an extreme. But I can't do this alone, and I'm not going to leave her to battle this disease when she doesn't have the capacity to do so. 

Trust me, I'm not playing some kind of Saint or martyr here by helping her when she's been awful to her children. It just makes me angry and frustrated that this is falling on my head, alone! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ I don't see this as them necessarily caring for her, but I need their emotional support! I don't feel like they care.

I've already had a small taste of what my duties (not even physical care) will include. Just coordinating her medical care, fixing her finances, figuring out how future inpatient care will be paid for (because my mom has no way to pay and neither do her kids), trying to find a way to keep her in her current dwelling as long as possible and maybe with some help.... list goes on and on! And I know you all understand these kinds of issues, and the hurdles that come with navigating the life of a parent with Alzheimer's. 

I feel like I'm just whining now. üò≠üò≠üò≠

But I guess I can only take this one day at a time. Every day is a new mountain to climb, and I'm already tired. But I haven't even started yet!

Thanks for reading, and if you have any advice (NOT ABOUT MY SIBLINGS), or can provide more insight into Alzheimer's disease, and why it's different from ""garden variety dementia"" I'd love to hear it!

zdt6ho,Alzheimers,Depressed and concerned abouty mother's latter stages of Alzheimer's,"My mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in late 2018, realistically we knew she had dementia/Alzheimer's from 2016. It was a long painful process getting a diagnosis, she wasn't willing to admit to herself and others that something was wrong as well as others brushing it off as ""just getting old"". Her condition has advanced steadily throughout the years and in the last 6months became incredibly hard to deal with. The bulk of her day to day care since diagnosis has been from my dad, with myself going over for a few hours to full days as much as I can, usually 3 or 4 times a week whilst also holding together my job in company QA and auditing. For the last couple years she states repeatedly that she wants to go home, in my reading about this it's more of a sense of familiarity rather than a specific place, seeing as she's lived in the same home for around 40 years. Over the last few months her desire to get out has been very hard to manage, up until a few weeks ago she had trips out to a daycare centre 2 times a week as well as carers taking her out for another 2 days in an attempt to give her the adventure or escape she wants. She often rattles doorknobs at night, and has attempted (sometimes succeeded) climbing out windows to escape, and when I try to say something like ""we'll stay here for today and go out tomorrow"" her responses vary from calm and understanding to wildly unresponsive and borderline aggressive. For the record she has never been aggressive at all throughout her life, and still is not, just lots of deep screams and flailing arms and stomping around. She's only 71 and went to the gym several times a week for decades, therefore she's still incredibly physically capable, strong and energetic. She moved into a beautiful care home last week, which was personally the most traumatic experience of my life, just a very painful day. After a few days of things largely being okay, and giving her space to get used to newer surroundings and faces I was called there today due to her supremely agitated and upsetting behaviour. She was banging doors, screaming and running around, upsetting the other residents. The head nurse told me she was taken aback by how active she is and her determination to get outside. In her struggles at the care home she hurt her back/hip by trying to smash down doors. I'm concerned the home will not allow her to stay if she keeps exhibiting this erratic behaviour, as she's likely functioning on fight or flight at this point and she's a fighter, at least in the sense that her strong will remains, and that instinct won't allow the carers to adequately do their job for all other residents. She can barely articulate anything other than she wants to go home/get out, cannot dress or bathe or use the toilet unassisted but somehow her desire to be out and active remains. Personally her battle with this disease has had a severe impact on my mental health, I rarely sleep more than 4 hours a night now, I am depressed and lost. Realistically I know she has only a few years left of life and just desire whatever she has left to be filled with as many happy moments as possible, as all she has left now are moments. I've sacrificed my own personal development, relationships and happiness to help her, something I know she would be mortified to learn if she was able to understand that. I plan on speaking to my work tomorrow to ask for a mental health break of a few weeks, to try help myself, as well as research and begin therapy for how I'm feeling. At this point in this post I'm just droning on and on, so I'll leave this here, if you made it through thank you for reading about my struggle, and my mum's. This woman has done more for me than I could ever put into words, she deserves the best and she would want the best for me as well.

1j9nc27,Alzheimers,This may help: The 7 Stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs,"The 7-stage model is a more detailed breakdown of Alzheimer‚Äôs progression, often associated with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), created by Dr. Barry Reisberg. The stages provide a more granular view of how Alzheimer‚Äôs disease progresses. Here‚Äôs a summary of each stage and how long it may last:

1. Stage 1: No Cognitive Decline
	‚Ä¢	Duration: No symptoms of Alzheimer‚Äôs; could last for years before the disease is noticed.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms: No memory or cognitive impairment. No noticeable changes.

2. Stage 2: Very Mild Cognitive Decline
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last several years (sometimes 2‚Äì4 years).
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Mild memory lapses (e.g., forgetting names or where things were placed).
	‚Ä¢	No obvious symptoms to others, but the person may notice the mild lapses.
	‚Ä¢	The person still functions well in daily life, and no impact on job or social relationships.

3. Stage 3: Mild Cognitive Decline
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last 2-7 years.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Noticeable memory loss (e.g., forgetting names, appointments, or events).
	‚Ä¢	Difficulty concentrating or recalling words during conversations.
	‚Ä¢	Decreased ability to plan and organize.
	‚Ä¢	The person may start losing confidence in their ability to perform tasks, but can still be independent with minimal help.
	‚Ä¢	These signs may be noticed by close family or friends.

4. Stage 4: Moderate Cognitive Decline (Mild Dementia)
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last 2-3 years.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Forgetfulness of recent events or personal history.
	‚Ä¢	Difficulty performing complex tasks (e.g., paying bills or managing finances).
	‚Ä¢	Decreased ability to maintain conversations and recall personal information.
	‚Ä¢	May show signs of mood changes, such as depression or anxiety.
	‚Ä¢	The person may need assistance with some daily tasks but can still function in familiar environments.

5. Stage 5: Moderately Severe Cognitive Decline (Moderate Dementia)
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last 1.5-3 years.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Major memory loss (e.g., forgetting their address, phone number, or close family details).
	‚Ä¢	Can no longer live independently. Requires help with daily activities such as dressing or preparing meals.
	‚Ä¢	Disorientation regarding time and place (e.g., forgetting the day of the week).
	‚Ä¢	Still may be able to maintain some conversation, but their responses may be incorrect or inappropriate.
	‚Ä¢	May need assistance with personal hygiene and other activities of daily living.

6. Stage 6: Severe Cognitive Decline (Severe Dementia)
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last 2-3 years.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Severe memory loss, including inability to recognize close family members.
	‚Ä¢	Significant difficulty with communication; may lose the ability to speak or use words meaningfully.
	‚Ä¢	May exhibit behavioral changes such as paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations.
	‚Ä¢	Loss of motor skills, including difficulty walking, dressing, or eating.
	‚Ä¢	Requires full-time care for daily activities, including feeding, bathing, and toileting.
	‚Ä¢	Loss of awareness of surroundings.

7. Stage 7: Very Severe Cognitive Decline (Very Severe Dementia)
	‚Ä¢	Duration: Can last 1-2 years or longer, but individuals may live for several years after reaching this stage.
	‚Ä¢	Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Near-complete loss of ability to communicate verbally.
	‚Ä¢	Inability to perform any self-care (e.g., unable to walk or feed themselves).
	‚Ä¢	Total dependence on caregivers for every aspect of daily life, including personal hygiene and mobility.
	‚Ä¢	Loss of the ability to respond to environmental stimuli.
	‚Ä¢	The person may no longer recognize family members and may lose the ability to control bodily functions.
	‚Ä¢	Many individuals may lose the ability to swallow food, which can lead to other complications.

Duration of the Stages:

The time spent in each stage can vary greatly between individuals, with some people experiencing a relatively slow progression and others showing a more rapid decline. The total course of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, from the onset of symptoms to the end, typically lasts between 8-10 years, but some people may live much longer.

It‚Äôs also important to note that Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is unique to each individual, so the timeline and symptoms can be different from one person to another.

1l4zved,Alzheimers,The Cause of Alzheimer's Might Be Coming From Within Your Mouth,"In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis: Alzheimer's disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, but the product of infection.

While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are still trying to isolate, numerous studies suggest the deadly spread of Alzheimer's goes way beyond what we used to think.

One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.

In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of Porphyromonas gingivalis ‚Äì the pathogen behind chronic periodontitis (aka gum disease) ‚Äì in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.

But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.

530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1
P. gingivalis' gingipains (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)

""Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing,"" Dominy said at the time.

""Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, P. gingivalis, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis.""

In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.

But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

That's important, because while P. gingivalis and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known ‚Äì to put it simply ‚Äì whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.

dentist checking x rays
Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene? (Jonathan Borba/Unsplash)
The fact that low levels of gingipains were evident even in people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's could be a smoking gun ‚Äì suggesting they might have developed the condition if they had lived longer.

""Our identification of gingipain antigens in the brains of individuals with AD and also with AD pathology but no diagnosis of dementia argues that brain infection with P. gingivalis is not a result of poor dental care following the onset of dementia or a consequence of late-stage disease, but is an early event that can explain the pathology found in middle-aged individuals before cognitive decline,"" the authors explained in their paper.

Further, a compound formulated by the company called COR388, showed in experiments with mice that it could reduce bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, while also reducing amyloid-beta production and neuroinflammation.

We'll have to wait and see what future research will uncover about this link, but the research community is cautiously optimistic.

""Drugs targeting the bacteria's toxic proteins have so far only shown benefit in mice, yet with no new dementia treatments in over 15 years it's important that we test as many approaches as possible to tackle diseases like Alzheimer's,"" chief scientific officer David Reynolds from Alzheimer's Research commented in a statement.

The findings were reported in Science Advances.

1m00iud,Alzheimers,Being Secretive vs Not Discussing Alzheimer's,"I'm having a really hard time with this. My Mom, my Dad's main caregiver, is of the opinion that nothing regarding my Dad's health/Alzheimer's should be discussed in front of him. My Dad knows he has memory loss, jokes about it. My Mom is constantly ushering people to a quiet corner to talk about Dad. Her stress, her drama, what she thinks is going on. She often discusses how stressed she is with visitors, and will abruptly stop talking when Dad walks in the room. She has started taking & making phone calls outside so he can't hear her calling in prescriptions, making appointments, etc. All very obvious changes from the norm & frankly, it pisses me the hell off, especially the ""Your father did"" blah blah blah rants in hushed tones that he can undoubtedly hear. He's got memory issues, he's not stupid. 


She gets irate over Dad forgetting where he put his flashlight or spilling birdseed when he refills the feeder, although he will happily look for his flashlight by himself for hours, and clean up the birdseed without any reminders at all. & she loves to come running to tell me about every little violation in whispers when I get there to help every day - as if spilling birdseed was purposeful or has anything to do with alzheimer's. She has been getting irate at these occurrences ""I don't have !@#$ time to look for your f'ing flashlight again!"" or ""G!D!M'F'r he just spilled the f'ing birdseed, I should just throw it the F away, blah, blah, blah!!!"" & rants the entire time he was cleaning about 1/2  cup of birdseed off the floor. It's insanity. Utter insanity. 


 She also recently took a few days for herself & went on a little getaway. She refused to tell Dad ahead of time, just up & left the day of, leaving me, mostly, to try to explain to my Dad why she went to their favorite getaway without him. I tried to explain that she has a lot of stress due to his memory loss issues & her worries about aging in general & she just needed a repreive to de-stress. 


This all caused him to think she's having an affair. (There is zero chance of that.) & I think we are now seeing our first glimpse of alzheimer's related delusion, as he cannot let this go & he is not acting like himself about it. 


I have noticed that when she goes outside to take a call, or when she corners someone to talk in hushed tones then clams up as Dad walks into the room, Dad takes note & will make comments  like ""I think your Mom is having an affair. I think she's out on the phone with him now. I'm just so heartbroken, I don't know what to do.""


So I decided today to tell my Mom that she needs to stop. That the ""secrecy"" is triggering Dad. That she is actually escalating the situation by behaving this way. & she pushed back that x,y,z specialists all say that you should not discuss the diagnosis with the alzheimer's patient.  I don't see calling in a prescription as ""discussing the diagnosis with the Alzheimer's patient"".  


This is escalating into screaming matches between the two of them. (& is 100% escalated by my Mom. This is not just an ""alzheimer's caused"" issue.) & now my extremely stubborn mother is threatening to call police & let ""the authorities decide how to handle your father"". 


FFS I am at my wits end. 
That was a small portion of the venting I need to do. But I want to know, where is the line between ""not discussing the diagnosis with the patient"" & being over the top loony tunes about secrecy. He KNOWS & accepts that he has ""age related memory loss"". He does not remember the subsequent dementia or alzheimer's diagnosis. 


Does anyone have a good internet link for info, because my Mother also will not listen to me, but ""Dr Google"" she puts all her faith into. 
This is so freaking frustrating. My Dad has said he wants a divorce & honestly I wish he could do that. Separating these two would solve so many issues. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1m00iud/being_secretive_vs_not_discussing_alzheimers/,1752531774.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
1lyf47g,Alzheimers,My Wife's grandma likely has Alzheimer's. We're 27. Should we offer her to live with us?

Within a month span, her dog she cherished like a child died and her boyfriend of 15 years left her (likely cuz of the impairment).

We're thinking about offering her to live with us permanently until AL or something. We have a lot to learn and are new to this, any advice would be really appreciated, thank you.

1gv9lfv,Alzheimers,"Why do most adults who have an early diagnoses of Alzheimers (but who are still mentally competent at time of diagnoses) choose to live with & ultimately die from the disease, instead of taking control of their future and choosing a faster, easier death?","New member of this group & a primary caretaker for elderly relative with dementia. I've been their 24/7 caretaker for the last seven months, and I'm keenly aware that we haven't even gotten near the hard part yet--I am so not looking forward to the next however many years! 

Anyway, I can't help but wonder why many (most!) people who receive an Alzheimers diagnosis don't instead choose to take control of their destiny & make an early exit? I understand that death is scary, but the progression of this disease is well documented, and since there is no cure, why do rational adults choose to subject themselves and their loved ones to many YEARS of hell instead of simply checking out early? Clearly it's hard to know what one would do in this situation until you are facing it yourself (God forbid) but I think I'd willingly give up several good months or a good year in exchange for bypassing years of mental anguish & a life of indignity. 

Apologies in advance if discussions of this type are not allowed here--I read the rules and didn't read anything expressly forbidding discussing death with dignity &/or the options available to someone facing an Alzheimers diagnosis.

1lp4ao3,Alzheimers,"For those of you with Alzheimer's (like me -- I think I'm mid-stage), what do you wish other people should know about you and your feelings?","I'll kick it off!

I sure didn't ask for it. My symptoms started in 2019 (I'm now 76) and worsened thereafter. I wasn't diagnosed until January of this year and only after I repeatedly requested a blood test for this condition. PrecivityADS2 diagnosed me with Alzheimer's, and this is consistent with my history of MCI, the scans performed on me, my persistently worsening symptoms, my speech and balance difficulties, etc., etc. I definitely knew that something was off kilter.

As I have noted here before, I was very irritated that when I described my symptoms and said I felt I fit with the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's, I was repeatedly told by others on this site that I probably did not have this condition, that I was over-reacting, etc. When I pointed out that CoPilot AI said that my symptoms suggested Alzheimer's, and when I noted that I was a super-responder to Aricept and that this suggested that I have this condition, I was also repeatedly met with strong denial that this was the case. (The only reason I was given Aricept was because I repeatedly requested it, and I have found Aricept and Namenda extremely helpful to me.)

While I am sure that quite a few people believe that they have AD when they do not, I feel strongly that people leaping to the conclusion that I must have been wrong about my condition was a mistaken thing to do. Also, I think that such a view may prevent some people from seeking early treatment for themselves or for their loved ones.

Further, I have been furious at times with statements that Aricept and Namenda cannot improve the functioning of those with Alzheimer's. (This has happened here even quite recently) Clearly these medications cannot help everyone, but they do help up to half of the people with this condition to function better. For some people (and I think I am one of them), they work very, very well, at least for a while! I have repeatedly stated that I do not believe that these medications reverse the condition but they sure make the symptoms easier for me to cope with. 

Aricept and Namenda are two of the most prescribed medications for controlling Alzheimer's symptoms, and I was extremely angry when I saw them derided time and again by people sharing their incorrect opinions about them. Those kinds of personal opinions can be -- and are -- harmful to many of those who want to improve their own functioning or the functioning of their loved ones. 

I'd also like to add the message from someone on this site about a year ago who said that he was functioning in a quite demanding job but that he was given Aricept and was able to continue working. He said that he was given this medication in spite of the fact he was not diagnosed by his physician with Alzheimer's. I believe that a lot of physicians understandably are reluctant to diagnose Alzheimer's (even tentatively) because of how their patients may react to this label. 

What I am facing now is going to be very different from what I will be facing later on, but at this point, I think I'm functioning pretty darned well. I hugely enjoy my life, the things I do, my family, etc. And I do enjoy laughing at many things around me -- but hopefully I never laugh at the limitations, fears, or worries or problems of others.

I am always going to react very strongly to those who pooh-pooh medications which have worked for me (Aricept and Namenda) -- as I noted above, they do not work for everyone but they work for a lot of people. I am appalled that some ignorant people are not aware of this but continue to spread misinformation about these treatments even after being corrected.

I also have found CoPilot AI and CHATGPT useful in helping me with understanding and treating my Alzheimer's condition. I have been repeatedly told on this site that these forms of AI are wrong and are not useful but I see no proof of that. To the contrary, while they may make errors at times, I examine the answers they and ask myself whether they make sense, whether they comport with what I am experiencing, with my history, with the literature on Alzheimer's.

Again, I repeat that I was told here at different times that I shouldn't worry about having this condition but that early advice was absolutely wrong. I am very, very glad I persisted and learned my condition and methods to improve my functioning. I feel it's better to know the devil you're facing than not knowing it.

Also, two more observations: 

1. I wish that testing for this condition would be offered more widely.  My neurologist initially denied my requests for this measure, my pcp deferred to my neurologist regarding testing and didn't order it for me (I understand his reasoning), and I searched very widely anyone to allow me to have testing for it but could find no physician who would authorize it. But as I was well over 21, I don't see why I could not have accessed the testing earlier. It would have allowed me to plan for the future much more easily.

And, 2. I wish more physicians would consider Aricept on a trial basis, even if no clear diagnosis of Alzheimer's has been made. I had the side-effect of diarrhea with Aricept (pretty common reaction) but this symptom did not last long and men's depends underwear was very effective. But if more people with possible symptoms of Alzheimer's were given Aricept (like me), they may well be able to continue working, might have their symptoms reduced, and using Aricept may lead to an earlier diagnosis of this condition.

Another development -- I now have anemia from diverticular bleeding. Wow! This condition really takes the wind out of my sails! I do everything very slowly, and can't do much physical activity, but I learned 10 minutes ago that my PCP's referral for me to have 5 iron infusions over the next two weeks has been approved and I am hugely looking forward to the benefits of this! I'll then be able to exercise, walk more easily, be able to pester my far-better half more, etc., etc.

Anyway, I'd be very interested in any thoughts my views of Alzheimer's, especially from those who have this condition. (I was going to say ""suffering from this condition"", but really I am not suffering now.) But ALL thoughts are welcome!

I'm wishing all the very, very best!  (I've got a pretty tough skin, having been in Toastmasters Speaking Club for 35 years.)

I wish I could have read something like this 6 years ago! I think this will help a lot of people worrying about this condition for themselves and others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1lp4ao3/for_those_of_you_with_alzheimers_like_me_i_think/,1751382940.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1k3l070,Alzheimers,How to calm and reorient your loved one with alzheimers-- it really works. (Cross Posted),"I have posted about this is comments responding to others, but have never made a whole post about it. We cared for my mother-in-law in our home for fourteen years until she died in September.  My own parents moved in with us this past summer and we are on a similar journey with them. They aren't at this point yet.

My mother-in-law, like most people with alzheimers or other denentia, was incredibly confused and agitated the last few years, and just wanted to go HOME. In the beginning before we understood what was going on, we used to try to gently remind her that her husband or parents had passed away. This was news every time, and she'd suddenly remember, and she'd be overcome with fresh grief. And like most people in her situation, she wanted to go HOME. And there was no convincing her that's she WAS home already. 

We were trying to be honest and reorient her into reality and we made everything so much worse.

She used to visit us for longer and longer periods when our (now grown) children were young. So one day I just  decided to play along and join her in HER reality.  When I walked into her room I pretended that she had just arrived for a visit. I lit up and acted excited to see her. I thanked her for coming to visit. I told her I'd put fresh towels in her bathroom and showed her where everything was. I showed her that I'd put ""those clothes you left here last time"" in this dresser here. I said I hoped the bed was comfortable and asked what else I could get her. I said she must be tired from all that traveling. And I asked what she'd like to do while she was here visiting.

It worked so well that we had the best morning we had had in a couple of years, and she was in a great mood. When she asked confusedly where her mother was, I answered that she'd ""gone to see those friends from church"" and would be back later. 

We all did this for her final years. In fact, when the agitation and hand-wringing set it, or she was angry because I was making her change clothes or I was cleaning her up, etc, I could say ""oh, gosh, you're going home already? Oh, I wish you could stay longer. We will miss you! Please come back soon.  Thanks for visiting us!  Let's get you cleaned up for your mom. I promised  her that when she came back to get you you'd be wearing that nice blue shirt she sent....""

It feels awful to LIE, but playing pretend feels a lot better. Join your loved one in THEIR reality. You can also placate them by having received news of some kind, like ""Oh, I'm so sorry! I forgot to tell you! Your grandpa called and said he stopped to see those friends from church and they were having trouble with their mower, so he is going to spend the night at their house and pick you up in the morning instead. I'm so sorry I forgot to mention it! Wow, he sure is good at fixing things, isn't he? I bet he gets that mower going. ... last time he was here; he fixed my car! Has he fixed a lot of stuff at your house? Oh, really? Oh, that's right! That WAS such a nice Oldsmobile. Didn't you have a Corvair, too?...."" and you lead them into the  favorite stories they like to tell.  

It's like the world's saddest constant game of improv, but it really, really works. It joins them in THEIR reality and is incredibly reassuring to them. It also gives you a reason that bathing (or changing a sodden disposable brief or putting on more sheets or whatever) needs to be done RIGHT NOW instead of waiting until later, or needs to be done ""AGAIN"" even though they claim they JUST already did whatever it is. 

As in improv theatre, you start with ""YES."" This affirms and reassures them. Don't argue that they have been wearing that smelly shirt for four days, that no, they did NOT change it already, no need to make them even more belligerent and bewildered. Instead, you say, ""YES, AND your mom wants you to wear those new pajamas she sent. She will be so glad you remembered! Oh, let's hurry! She'll be here soon! Let's change and then go pick some flowers to give her when she arrives! ""

When you go to give them breakfast and they're handwringing and upset because ""the wedding is today!"" Or ""where are the children?!"" Just play along and steer the reality. ""YES, and  we need to get ready.."" ""they're with those friends from church until later today....""

This is such a sad, hard job. But the ""visit fantasy"" helps tremendously.  It helps you,  it helps them even more. Imagine how scary and disconcerting it must be to wake up surrounded by semi-strangers in a weird place where nothing works as it should and you're confused and bewildered, and you just want to go HOME. Then these strangers tell you your mom had been dead for twenty years and that this IS your house-- what is happening?! Why are these awful people trying to trick you?! And then they pull out an old funeral program, or the family Bible and oh my gosh, that looks like YOUR havdwriting with your mother's death dare written in it, and the wave of heartbreak and fresh grief overwhelms you, and you'll do anything to get out of this dystopia  nightmare, and the nightmare keeps happening over and over, and cones in waves, and no one understands, and they keep calling you ""grandpa"", but you're nobody's grandpa, you're not old enough, why are tey trying to play this evil trick. You just want to go HOME. You want your MOTHER. 

Join them in that reality and reassure them. ""Let's get your hair washed since your mom is coming to pick you up. What should we make for our dinner with her?"" Distract and reassure. Over and over and over.

1lyr4fd,Alzheimers,Some helpful info from a cna who cares for dementia clients.,"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I‚Äôve worked with elderly and Alzheimer‚Äôs clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I‚Äôve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often‚Äîsome are hard to talk about, but I hope they‚Äôre helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they‚Äôre confused by unfamiliar faces.
It‚Äôs not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they‚Äôre alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa‚Äîthey might act confused at home but appear ‚Äúfine‚Äù at the doctor‚Äôs office, making you feel like you‚Äôre imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they‚Äôve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in ‚Äúlike an animal‚Äù just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn‚Äôt always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don‚Äôt wait for a crisis.
I can‚Äôt stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I‚Äôve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions‚Äîthey are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don‚Äôt rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It‚Äôs not giving up‚Äîit‚Äôs about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I‚Äôve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone‚Äîyour loved one and their caregivers‚Äîsafer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we‚Äôre informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.

1lvxbs5,Alzheimers,My mother is showing clear signs of dementia and I am moving away.,"Hi, let me preface this by saying:
I was on a long car ride with my dad today and we talked a lot about my mom. Now it all feels real. 

I am turning 25 in two days and in about a month I‚Äôll be moving away to get my masters degree. My mom has been showing poor cognitive functionality for a while now but the last two weeks she started to forget a lot. (The city I‚Äôll be moving to even though we just came back from a potential flat I was looking at, certain names and dates, recent stuff etc.)
She is oblivious to all this (or at least it seems that way) and all her life up till now she always said Alzheimers was her biggest fear.

I am afraid of not being able to see her every week. I want to be there for her and I am deeply afraid of the moment she will realise that she probably has dementia. 
A few years ago a doctor told her that she could develop it and she got suicidal. 

I don‚Äôt even know why I am writing this but it all feels so real now. 
I thought I would have more time.
More time to give her memories.
She probably won‚Äôt really be there for the big milestones and it hurts like hell. 
On the one hand I feel like I failed her by being slow in life and not having achieved more like a family and a grandchild.
On the other I feel so deeply sorry for my father who told me he will do everything for her, cause it is his duty as a husband. (They had a rocky marriage and there is not much love anymore.)
In a weak moment he told me that this is it for him and that this is his life now. He doesn‚Äôt care about fulfilment or happiness anymore. He just does his duty. It hurts to see both my parents loose their future. It hurts that there is no hope whatsoever. 

Fuck this disease and fuck fate

1hmx8ml,Alzheimers,Why isn‚Äôt it ethical to force a dementia patient to wear Depends/get changed?,"My Nana has been having some fecal incontinence lately, and it‚Äôs been a HUGE problem. Whenever she came to the house yesterday, she REEKED of shit, and it stunk up my entire car bc I drove her to and from the memory care facility. I asked my mom why she doesn‚Äôt wear Depends, and she replied that the memory care has tried, but she refuses. My question was: why don‚Äôt they MAKE her? She replied that they couldn‚Äôt do that, that it was unethical and would require manhandling her, which the staff aren‚Äôt allowed to do.

I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre not allowed to force her to, though. Alzheimer‚Äôs patients are like toddlers. A defiant two-year-old might refuse to have their diaper changed willingly, but it‚Äôs unsafe, unsanitary, and offensive to the nose to keep them in a shitty diaper until they give consent to be changed. You don‚Äôt GIVE the two-year-old the choice. You just DO IT to protect them from infections. Why aren‚Äôt they allowed to do the same to dementia patients?

Like, I would rather my Nana be manhandled into wearing Depends than marinating in shitty panties for hours on end bc she refuses to let the memory care people help her change. She‚Äôs going to end up with fucking urosepsis at this rate, and I am NOT ok with that. I don‚Äôt understand the logic here.

This might sound really callous, like I don‚Äôt care about my Nana‚Äôs human rights or whatever. That‚Äôs not the case. I just don‚Äôt want her dying of urosepsis because she‚Äôs constantly marinating in her own *shit* day in and day out. That‚Äôs not a fun way to go.

1cvsho6,Alzheimers,"I've no reason to think I've beginning stages of Alz, but am wondering about 'normal' memory loss","Hi everyone.  Not sure if this is the right place to post this but... I'm 61, and no reason to 'suspect' I will ever get Alzheimers, nor that I may be in very early stages.

However, a particular family member (and one who can be challenging to all other family members, at times, and who often exaggerates things) recently commented to me - and in a not very nice, sort of 'irritated' way - that I've been repeating myself for a number of months now.

When I think of the instances where she was more likely to say this to me, it was when I said things like 'I'm watching such and such on Netflix...have you seen it...it's so good?'  ('Yes, we've already discussed this a thousand times..') or 'I got a pizza the other day with a cauliflower crust...have you ever had a cauliflower crust?.....so good...'  ('Yes, you've already told me that, multiple times...')

In other words, most of the things I repeat are inconsequential, random things that I surely also say to the many other family members and friends that I speak with, and on a regular basis.  I often talk about things I recently enjoyed, movies and TV shows that I think are great and want to share/recommend with others.  And I think it's natural to not remember who I told what, when it comes to such trivial things.

What do y'all think?  Would you say that this is 'normal' forgetful behavior, and for folks like myself who have a good number of different people that I talk to on a regular basis?

1gun307,caregivers,Mothers opiate medication dc'd while in hospice care.,"Going to be as to the point as possible here.  My mother has been in opiate medicating for 25+ years.  My whole life, she has had a severe case of crohns disease( the gut pain was original reason to be put on lortabs). In recent years she has developed duodenal cancer( which eventually led to 3/4 of her stomach being cut out, alomg with several feet of both intestine from previous crohns complications). After that she was placed on at home tpn( vein food), she could still eat, but just small amounts. Id say about 4 years ago she started going to the methadone clinic.  She recently went on hospice care, and after a short stint at one of their facilities was placed on fentanyl and morphine. And then sent back home which ended up being my home because she can no longer take care of herself where she was at before. She has had a history of overtaking her medicine so I do understand some of their trepidation. But the medicine they're giving her it just isn't enough. The reason she went on hospice mainly, was because she fell and had a hematoma that ended up getting infected and now it won't heal. Her leg is literally necrotizing as her body Withers away in front of me. Even with all the medicine they're giving her she's still clearly in pain. It sucks and it's hard. So she overtakes her medicine to take away the pain because it's there. Today when the nurse came she was one patch past where she was supposed to be, and they ended up taking away the patches completely, and cutting the morphine in 1/4. Now they're saying that her medicine amount will never go up again and basically forcing her into a home where they can monitor her medicine intake more closely. My mother wants to die with someone she loves there, and while it's a burden, I want to be able to do that for her. It's really hurting her to have to go to this facility. And me as well because I feel like I failed her and should have monitored her more closely. But at the same time I feel like the whole point of Hoss's care is to not hurt, so whatever it takes to facilitate that I feel like should happen. She also has short bowel syndrome very bad, so that contributes to the medicine not working very well with for her. Basically I don't know it just it feels wrong and I'm wondering if there's anything I can do or any suggestions. I did talk to text for a lot of this and I really don't have time to proofread it so I'm sorry if there's any errors, I will check it when I have a moment later after I get her in bed for the night. Because of her being on hospice care they will not treat her legs aggressively or what not so they're literally riding away in front of me. It feels very inhumane and doesn't feel like any sort of death with dignity. I feel like if you were not to go to this facility now she will die just from withdrawals because she's already the only probably have a few weeks left. I just don't understand. Especially, because my grandmother was using the same hospice company and they way over prescribed her medicine when she really didn't need it it was short all the time. With my grandmother I do feel like she was chasing a high, with my mother she's very obviously in a lot of pain. Her legs I just can't even, i don't have words, it's very bad.I could dm some pictures if anyone wanted them for context for how bad it is.  Again I will edit later this is really kind of a rough draft. I just wanted to get the post out there so there's more time for someone to see it. Because I don't have much time left with her. I feel helpless. And I'm not making this post to bash the doctors cuz I understand liability and how long you know the laws are regarding narcotics. But I just feel like there has to be something to make this work. They also said that regardless of if she's on schedule for medication from here on out that it will never go back up again. I told the nurse that they might as well take her now because you're basically torturing her and me I don't know. I feel like I'm rambling now, so I'll check back later.

5g38s5,caregivers,Still not sure what to do...,"My main question is how do I get care if I don't qualify and can't pay?

I was lucky when I developed Crohn's at puberty, my mom was a hospice nurse long before and was able to bathe me several times per day. She had a slow progressing cancer and died soon after stabilized. The only problem is, I never really stabilized. Now I'm 29 and I still am not sure how to get help to become a productive member of society. I don't know how much longer I should hold out hope. Those who have family to care for them are so lucky. My family preferred to throw things away rather than offer them to me.

The Crohn's is bearable. It's not being able to do anything more than meet my most basic needs that is frustrating, and that I will never be able to find love, and friendship often seems out of reach. Also probably ADD, I'm so scatterbrained, you will often catch me going back and forth from room to room as I remember something I needed, like a pair of socks, or frozen peas. When I'm sick, it gets 100 times worse. Yes, just sick, no special name for it. I've been to the ER so many times for dehydration I can't even count. Sorry but some people are not cut out for giving care, not even for themselves. I'm actually a bit optimistic that, if I were to get care, maybe my health will improve enough so I can get a job or go to college.

8eqkw2,caregivers,Is there something like state paid caregiving for anxiety anywhere in the US?,"I don't know if caregiver is too strong of a word. I need someone to be around to help me focus on tasks that I have mental blocks against doing due to childhood trauma. Something between a personal assistant, attendant, caregiver, manager, mother, wife, little voice. Unfortunately it often requires cooperation, so phone assistance isn't very effective. Yeah, I know, sounds very codependent. My current helper uses that word every day. I'm M/30 so it's extra awkward I guess.

...

In WA it looks like caregiver isn't the right fit. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options after over a decade. Therapy and home caregiving is not very available in the area I'm in, and I'm extremely willing to move to get proper treatment, but I have a poorly managed autoimmune disorder and possible ADD/OCD and a sleep disorder and major depression in addition to social anxiety, and I've never held a job, so I have to rely on the kindness of complete strangers for help. I have no real life friends or family who can help.

...

There's a real and valid need, and I know I have potential to work if I get help, at least that's what everyone (offline) tells me anyways. Problem is, I don't fit the criteria for a caregiver, and I need help just to make phone calls, the anxiety is that bad with talking to strangers.

1m2sk1o,caregivers,My In-Laws Judge being a caregiver.,"I recently became a caregiver for a company. I have been looking for a job for about 6 months, and this one is perfect for me and my husband.¬† I tend to notice that if it is not a job that is approved by them it is looked down upon. To make a long story short, I did not tell my in-laws until I was done with training so as to not have any negative feedback color my new experience, because that is typically what they lead with. Once I had finished training and had my first week of clients we announced my new job. My mother in law was pretty quiet, my father in law happy, but a bit concerned for my safety. His only experience with someone needing caregiving was a violent man, he thought this was the majority of my clients. He was worried for my safety and asked questions but once he understood that my company would support me if I was in danger he was relieved. He then made a point to tell me he was proud of me and suggested we should have a celebration dinner. My mother in law again asked little to no questions, which is unusual for her. Because of how MIL's side of the family freely judges other family members' financial choices and gossip, my husband and I keep our finances close to our chest since it is not their concern and we do not agree with everyone's noses in our business. I did not mention my hourly pay exactly but did mention that it was something I was happy with.

A few nights ago my husband went over to their house without me working out with his dad like he always does a few times a week. My mother-in-law and her mother were there as well as it was mother-in-law‚Äôs father‚Äôs birthday, and they were having dinner together. Mother-in-law and her mother started talking about how they think that I will ""catch diseases"" from the people I will be caregiving for because ""I am not clean enough‚Äù. The other concerns they had is that I would be doing this for ‚Äúminimum wage‚Äù. That they could never wipe someone else‚Äôs butt, change someone‚Äôs diaper, or do any of the peri care. But they way they said it was, as if I was dishonorable for being nonplussed to do these tasks for a job. I care about the people I care for, I feel like I have a chance to make a difference everyday.¬†I would say out of everyone that I have told, most have a negative reaction and say ""I could never do that"" or ""It takes a saint."" both give me a negative vibe, not an encouraging one.

They both literally admitted to having OCD about being clean. I‚Äôm a clean person and I passed training for this. I also hold a food handlers card, and would say I keep my own house clean, as also my husband would agree, although it‚Äôs not up to his mothers standards due to whatever flaw she can find. Once when she watched our cats at our house, I deep cleaned the house because I know how she is and she still had problems.

It hurts that they would gossip, as they are the only family around and I see them at least 2x a week and for almost every holiday.I plan to make a powerpoint addressing this as a more light hearted way to be direct, because I know I will either be too hurt to be too direct. Does anyone have points I could add? Sassy or just aspects I am not thinking of. I just want to show the positives and why this works for our family.

EDIT TO ADD

My in laws are 85% of the time great and kind. They are there for me more than my own parents. Grey rocking them at this time will only make that relationship exponentially more strained. I do keep things from them until it is the right time to share it. I wish they were not so negative or outspoken about their ideas of what our life should be, our timeline, our beliefs. We usually have a nice time, it is just that the most unexpected things become a point of contention and I always feel like I have been caught off guard by another set of unforeseen issues. I do wish, hope, and pray one day that we can be close without causing me so much anxiety because I do try as hard as I can. I will call the hotline that my company offers on Sunday.

1hy00sx,caregivers,Rapid Mental Decline in My 65-Year-Old Mother: Desperate for Diagnosis & Long-Term Care Solutions,"Hello, I‚Äôm looking for guidance about how to get help for my mother, who has experienced rapid mental deterioration over the past year with a cycle of repeated hospitalizations and psychiatric decompensation at home. The situation is placing an unsustainable level of strain on my mother, father and the rest of our family. We need help securing a definitive diagnosis and finding longer-term care options before her condition worsens further. Any insights on recommended testing, navigating legal/insurance barriers, or locating a facility that can accommodate her complex needs would be greatly appreciated.

**Overview**

My 65-year-old mother, living at home in the San Francisco Bay Area with her supportive husband (age 68) and two sons nearby, has suffered a rapid and severe mental decline since returning from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia in February 2024. Previously, she was high-functioning‚Äîworking full time, cooking daily, exercising, active with friends, and was deeply caring for and involved with her sons. She had only mild, seasonal depression (1‚Äì2 weeks/year), mild insomnia, and urinary retention issues leading to occasional UTIs. In the last few years prior to 2024, family members noticed very subtle signs of cognitive slowdown (occasionally losing track of conversations or movie plots), though it was unnoticeable most of the time. Family history includes Parkinson‚Äôs (her father) and probable bipolar disorder (mother/grandmother).

She contracted a mild case of COVID on her trip and also reported poor sleep while abroad; upon returning, she developed profound depression, anxiety, and psychosis, plus repeated episodes of inconsolable yelling with ‚Äúverbal loops‚Äù and suicidal ideation lasting for hours. She also sometimes complains of tinnitus (ringing in her ears), and frequently claims not to have slept for several nights in a row‚Äîthough hospital staff and her husband have observed her sleeping soundly at times when she insists she has not slept. She no longer talks to friends, does not communicate proactively with family, rarely leaves the house, and has completely stopped cooking, driving, and exercising. She‚Äôs lost drastic amounts of weight (down to \~90 lbs at 5‚Äô8‚Äù at one point) due to months of reduced appetite and sometimes flat-out refusing food for days at a time. While she sometimes reports tingling or neuropathy in her limbs, she doesn‚Äôt show any motor or gait issues. Between crises of suicidality and agitation, she often appears emotionally flat and is very quiet, with her eyes somewhat glazed over.

**Treatment Barriers & Multiple Discharges**

Since February 2024, she‚Äôs been hospitalized and discharged eight times, ranging from short 2‚Äì3 day emergency holds to stays of up to a month in psychiatric facilities. Typically, she‚Äôs admitted on a 5150 or 5250 hold for suicidal ideation but is released once the ideation subsides or if a medical complication (often a UTI) forces a transfer out of psych. (Although she had recurrent UTIs for a while, they seem resolved now, yet her psychiatric symptoms persist.) My father has had to call 911 multiple times due to her severe distress and erratic behavior. She has left against medical advice more than once, and insurance or hospital policies often limit longer stays once she appears temporarily stable. Despite ongoing suicidality, agitation, and repeated crises (including attempts to flee facilities and impulsive aggression‚Äîshe has struck and bitten staff), doctors say she retains decision-making capacity, making a long-term LPS conservatorship difficult to secure. At home, she quickly decompensates‚Äîoften within weeks‚Äîforcing another hospitalization. Multiple psychiatrists have remarked on the unusually rapid pace of her decline (she was fully functional 10 months ago) and said they rarely see cases like hers.

**Refusal of Exams & Medications**

She frequently refuses diagnostic exams (e.g., lumbar puncture) and has been unwilling to complete inpatient cognitive testing (facilities insist it be done outpatient, but she decompensates before appointments). A wide range of blood tests (CBC, CMP, autoimmune panel) and imaging (MRI, CT) have returned normal, leaving her doctors stumped. She tried multiple psychiatric meds‚ÄîAmbien, Clonazepam, Propranolol, Effexor, Remeron, Auvelity‚Äîyet never stuck with any for more than a few weeks. None of these medications have produced a noticeable improvement. She underwent 12 rounds of ECT, only to abruptly quit claiming it was ‚Äúfrying her brain‚Äù. She attempted Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) but also stopped after two sessions. One psychiatrist strongly suspects a dementia process despite normal imaging.

**Current State**

It‚Äôs now January 2025, and there has been no improvement in her condition. She‚Äôs once again decompensating at home, and it‚Äôs highly likely she‚Äôll need another psychiatric hospitalization very soon. Meanwhile, my father (her primary caregiver) cannot safely manage her alone, and we still can‚Äôt secure longer-term placement due to her resistance, frequent discharges, and the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

We desperately need advice on (1) pursuing a clear diagnosis given her repeated refusals and outpatient cancellations, and (2) finding a stable, longer-term care solution that won‚Äôt discharge her prematurely. Any ideas on next steps for comprehensive testing, possible diagnoses, or navigating the legal and insurance barriers in California would be immensely appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1hy00sx/rapid_mental_decline_in_my_65yearold_mother/,1736498136.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1hjv142,caregivers,Still Learning 7 Months Later,"Im sorry in advance for the wall of text.

TLDR: Husband has severe TBI with side effects as expected. Neurologist avoided actually  helping the reason why we were seeing her and tried to prescribe random medications to help with some issues instead of addressing them. Also she never actually treated my husband for TBI. So he's gone 7 months without a proper TBI follow up. 

My husband (35 years old) was diagnosed with end stage liver disease back on March 29, 2024. He was told he would have to get frequent Paracentesis procedues to help with the associated Acites. I took him to the ER back at the end of April for the procedure and the admitted him to the hospital. He was a little confusdd and forgetful but otherwise normal. He was walking to and from bathroom, eating, dressing himself, etc. In May when i returned to visit him from home the resident physicians and a gastroenterologist said that my husband had a fall that caused a subdural hematoma on the right, frontal lobe causing a severe TBI, orbital fractures around his eyes, and a large laceration on the back, left side of his head. This fall caused him to have seizures that he's never had before. After a month in the hospital (inpatient rehab included- OT, ST, and PT) they sent him home. 

I had to have him back in the ER a couple weeks later for a seizure that broke through because he got sick and couldn't take his medicine. His neurologist that they gave us only did  circle drawing test back when she first saw him back at the end of June a couple weeks after that seizure. She did no other tests other than lab work. Ever since the fall he also has tremors. He did some in-patient PT, OT, and ST back in the hospital in May for the TBI/ seizures and due to the constant fluid build up from the Acites he was unable to continue outpatient therapy.

 I've never really been able to ask much about the status as I thought it would just take time. But in my gut I felt like we really don't know much of how he's doing since the head injury. I also felt she was not seeing him for the injury or at least didn't seem concerned.

Ever since the injury he still has memory problems, balance issues, tremors, high anxiety, difficulty making  decisions, some issues with words and occasionally sentences, and he still gets headaches on the right side of his head as well as the left near the laceration injury. He also has hearing trouble and ear pain on his left side. He has trouble processing stuff at times as well. He is now very emotional compared to what he used to be like (and I'm glad he can express himself more now). He cries semi frequently. 

He's not able to fully bend over still and requires use of his walker/ wheelchair. I know it's only been 7 months and he's still recovering but I'm not sure if this is normal or if I should be concerned. I feel like the neurologist should have seen him more frequently too especially with a TBI.

At his most recent appointment she said that she was only seing him for the seizures and not the TBI. She even stated that she was a neurologist but only seeing him for seizures when I asked what she thought of his current recovery status. When asked about his headaches she tried to tell him to take Excedrin. When asked about his anxiety she said well he already has Xanax. When asked about the tremors she didn't say anything else. She also wanted to prescribe a weightloss medication to help with the headaches we mentioned.

Should I have done something different? He hasn't had a proper follow up for 7 months following a severe TBI? What do you recommend I do now? We need a mental medical clearance to get him on the transplant list so I'm trying to find a Neurologist that specializes in TBI at the moment. And because he went so long without being able to make his appointments for ST and PT (the office and we agrees to wait for a month) they closed his case and his appintments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1hjv142/still_learning_7_months_later/,1734858687.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
14kuegi,caregivers,"So tired of this caregiving lifestyle, aita for wanting to move out? (Rant)","hey all. been in this thread for a while, and I‚Äôve noticed a high amount of 30~ year olds caretaking for their parents (and in the brink of insanity). I am also 30 and have been caretaking for about 10 years. It wasn‚Äôt until last year when my dads parkinsons started to get very bad, and my fianc√© left me, that I started to realize how much caretaking I was doing, and how much it was ruining my life. it wasn‚Äôt as hopeful & cheery as it was when he first got the diagnosis. My dads parkinsons got in the way of my schooling, social life, love life, work life, mental health, and my daily living skills routines, yet I didn‚Äôt realize how it was creeping into my life. I gained weight, snap at everyone, am late to everything, and I can‚Äôt believe how long it took me to realize how much of a martyr I was being. I loved caregiving at first, but now I can see how my dad abuses his privileges and will ask for so much. I feel bad because now he really does need my help but his temperament and nagging persona is not helpful for my patience. In fact, he was very negative and low vibe even before he got sick. So now that dementia is slowly kicking in, it‚Äôs been seriously ruining my sanity and mental heal. I have no siblings and it‚Äôs just us two, and we don‚Äôt have access to free resources so we have to pay for everything - which makes expensive assisted living not an option. 

I feel so envious of my other friends who get to enjoy fun trivial things like going out and not worrying about coming home early, or not having to wake up with impending anxiety wondering what the day holds : a fall? A day of more slavery? Being my dads therapist? I love him but damn! He sure is a handful with a ‚Äústrong personality.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I need my own space and I want to be an adult with my own apartment. I can no longer live at home with him but he has to move too because this current house is unsafe for him (stairs, remote area). I want to move out but be nearby and still help out. He will also need someone to help him, maybe we can find someone looking for a part time gig ?

I feel very guilty for wanting to plan this but I need that space and sanity! Im truly scared that my job will fire me for constantly being late or dressed inappropriately. I‚Äôve already lost friends and my fiance over having a short temper and no patience due to caregiving. My self regulation has been shot.  On top of that, I‚Äôve been meaner to him as a result of resentment. Then I feel guilty and it kills me !!!! All this caregiving has induced so much depression and anxiety that I don‚Äôt even care about my appearance anymore or have the time to even care! That‚Äôs not me. :( have any of you guys experienced that? Is it morally wrong to move out? How can I have a social life if I continually keep devoting my whole life to caretaking for a grumpy parent?",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/14kuegi/so_tired_of_this_caregiving_lifestyle_aita_for/,1687911746.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1bj6mj9,caregivers,Just venting,"I‚Äôm so glad I found this forum. 

I hope this is the right space for me to vent.

I‚Äôve been going to therapy for a bit and that helps but I feel like it‚Äôs better when people can relate to you.

It‚Äôs been about 2 years since my (30m) & I (30f) have had our lives change. At this point I had already been with him and living with him for 3 years. We are now going onto our 6 year together and have been engaged for a few months.


One day things just changed. He was healthy and had no symptoms, the next morning he woke up dizzy. He left to visit family for a few weeks and things just got worse from there. He was seeing double, dizziness, stomach problems, weakness and so many other things I honestly can‚Äôt count. He went to the ER and they didn‚Äôt find anything. He came back home and we began a long tedious process of seeing about 12 different doctors & specialists as well as visiting urgent care and the emergency room a few times. Long story short a year later, we found someone who could help him and he had Lyme disease. He has recovered and is now dealing with POTS. 

Throughout the process he has been bed ridden a few times for weeks at a time. I‚Äôve had to give up all my PTO to take him to all his appointments. I became his caregiver. I drove him everywhere. Helped him shower, brush his teeth and get his food for him. I‚Äôve blown friends and events off because he needed me. And I WFH so even while having to work a full time, on the phone job, I had to also do whatever else he needed of me. Between that and the constant calling out/ leaving early/ asking my manager for favors on my shift to take him to appointments, I would get anxious and stressed about my job. I also have work anxiety where I just feel like I‚Äôm always going to get fired.. so that did not help. 

Soon after I also became his therapist unwillingly and heard all his negative thoughts. And I mean every single one. It was such a drag being around him. Nothing positive ever came out of his mouth. Every solution given was followed up by another problem and so on. 

I began to sleep for an hour or sometimes even just wait for him to fall asleep so I could go to the bathroom and cry the entire night. I felt so overwhelmed and I didn‚Äôt have a single person in my life who could relate to me.

My friends questioned why I was still around - mostly because we weren‚Äôt married. And I never really opened up to them only to a certain extent because I didn‚Äôt want them to judge him more than they already were. 

I literally felt like I was trapped in a dark tunnel and there was really no way out. 

Things have gotten better now, he does more on his own and I‚Äôm so proud of him for that. But there‚Äôs definitely days and moments where I resent him. And I just can‚Äôt help it and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs normal or how to manage that. I know it‚Äôs mostly the diagnosis I really resent. I hate that it took so much time and memories away from us. 

Being a full time caregiver is no joke. Not even his own mother helped him the way I did when he was visiting them and feeling sick. I know sometimes I resent them too. They let me handle everything and never checked on me. In the two years, one of his sisters did end up asking me how I was holding up and I exploded into tears. I hadn‚Äôt had anyone ever ask me how I was . And in general I get the just that most caregivers don‚Äôt get asked if they‚Äôre okay or they need help too. Or even get thanked for all they do.

I know my rant is kind of all over the place. Thanks for reading. ‚ù§Ô∏è ",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1bj6mj9/just_venting/,1710914665.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1ltxmkg,caregivers,im scared my dad will die when im not with him - does anyone else have this fear?,"

i dont know how to write this but im scared my dad will die when im not next to him. im 20f and my dads been sick (chronic heart failure, myeloma (blood cancer)) since 2017, but 8 months ago he had a stroke (was in a coma and ICU for 2 months - every single day the doctors would tell us it'd be his last day, and they were going to take him off the ventilator if he hadn't woken up the day before), and i became his carer. 

i cook for him, clean, make sure he's mentally ok (90% of the time he isn't - and its super draining), help him move around, and make sure he takes his meds. and i dont mind any of that (dont get me wrong, there r some days where i do) but my biggest struggle is fear. 

he had a stroke when none of us were with him (i was on a friends holiday). and ever since (im the only one who lives with him), i have this constant fear hes gonna collapse or die at any moment (before i sleep, when im showering, when im out) and one day, ill come home to find him gone + it'll be my fault for not being there. before i go to sleep, i make sure to tell him i love him, and make sure he's still breathing. 

and theres no way for me to check if hes ok when im at uni or out. so i spam call him but i hate nagging or mothering him. he hates feeling nagged too. and its honestly the most draining thing to live in this fear (no matter how grateful i am hes still with us). 

when he was in the icu, what helped me cope was seeing his heart rate + BP on the screen 24/7. at least i knew he was still alive (even though he looked dead). but now that hes home, there's nothing to give me that peace of mind (i always have a panic attack when he doesnt answer my call - most of the time its cos hes sleeping). 

and because this has been my life for the past 8 months, i want to make something to help myself feel a bit more at ease when we're not physically there. but i also just wanted to ask - does anything feel this way? if yes, how do you cope with this fear?

sometimes ranting to strangers on reddit is where its at. if youre still reading, thank you so much <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1ltxmkg/im_scared_my_dad_will_die_when_im_not_with_him/,1751903221.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1gqs0ct,caregivers,This doesn‚Äôt feel so much like a marriage anymore ,"Hi everyone,

Since 2013, my 49-year-old wife has been hospitalized three times for major depressive episodes. She has twice attempted to end her life, the most recent attempt occurring in August of this year. She hasn't worked for a couple of years due to severe panic attacks that prevent her from holding a job. Currently, she attends an intensive outpatient program four nights a week to address repressed childhood trauma.

I've taken on the role of her caretaker, managing the seven different medications she needs to prevent another overdose. This has been incredibly challenging, as she consumes 100% of the emotional and mental energy in our relationship, leaving my needs as an afterthought. 

We no longer have a sexual relationship because she finds intercourse too painful and has no interest. She doesn‚Äôt cook because of an eating disorder; she used to be heavier but lost 80 pounds and is now terrified of gaining it back, often avoiding food until she nearly faints. She also doesn‚Äôt clean, so I‚Äôve had to hire a cleaning service to keep our home tidy.

I don‚Äôt know how much more I can do this. She is totally dependent on me for everything in her life and it is suffocating me. Our 25th wedding anniversary will happen in July, but I‚Äôm not sure I even want that to happen. I‚Äôve tried to tell her how unhappy I‚Äôve been but I‚Äôm not getting through. What should I do? Thanks for listening.

1e46txq,caregivers,"A request for advice, dealing with caregiver burnout","Hi everyone, I'm a 21 yo Uni student working part time who used to live and will soon be living indefinitely with my grandma and grandpa of 79 and 82 respectively, and I am looking for some advice from fellow caregivers on avoiding burnout dealing with senile dementia and overall try to best adapt to my home's new normal.

For some context, my grandfather had a stroke a few months after I was born and had mobility issues ever since, which have worsened in the last few years due to a series of falls which have left him wheelchair bound, which makes moving around our house on his own difficult due to narrow doorways.

My grandmother used to be his main caregiver, but after she had a fall while giving grandpa a shower, we decided for them to come live with us in Mexico, since there is no one to help them with daily chores back in our home country however this has really shaken up our family routine, mainly in the form of shouting, either from my grandpa requesting assistance, or my grandma angrily telling him to shut up, this is terrible for me, since I am VERY jumpy and sensitive to loud noises and would feel constantly uneasy while at home.

Many times Grandpa would forget what he had called me for by the time I went downstairs only to ask me again 5 minutes later, which becomes extremely frustrating in periods of the year where my academic load becomes really intense due to deadlines

They had lived with us for two years and even though I love them to bits, by last year's December I was exhausted and had panic attacks while at home or at Uni, we've had 7 months ever since they went back home, but they are coming back soon in what may be their last flight which means they will be staying for good.

It's specially tough bc of grandpa's mental decline and how fast it has been, it feels like the witty jokester I grew up with is gone, and any attempts to keep him mentally engaged, be that reading to him, listening to him tell stories or playing chess, things he used to really enjoy feel like they do not help at all
So, I am looking for some guidance, advice or resources on how to best help my grandparents and deal with the exhaustion, and frustration that comes with the job.

13gp1wd,caregivers,"For once, all I need him to do is not make things worse","I've been my partner's caregiver for about four years. It's not easy and his usually poor attitude really doesn't help. I've had my own serious medical issues so while it's impossible for me to relate to him entirely, I can empathize with him a lot. It's one of the reasons we got together (8 years).

But I am so angry right now. It's not uncommon for him to work himself up into a tizzy and there is no coming down from it. He'll start telling himself something and work himself into a panic attack and lash out at me. And this will *always* happen when I actually need him for something. **ALWAYS**. Maybe it's emotional support, maybe my parents are visiting, whatever I need him for he will prioritize himself and let me down. Pretty much every single time. It doesn't even surprise me anymore.

We're going through a difficult situation with our dog right now. I just needed him to watch the dog for 40 minutes but he'd woken up in a bad mood and not feeling well, and, like clockwork, convinced himself he needed to go back to bed after being up for an hour. I didn't make him feel bad about it, I just acquiesced as usual. He took a couple unnecessary shots at me (claiming it wouldn't be 40 minutes it'd be 2 hours, which is a claim that has no supporting data but these kinds of irrational declarations aren't uncommon from him; honestly, most of the time it feels like he doesn't even know me after eight years) and stormed off to bed. Now I'm sitting here with the inability to get ANYTHING done, chores, errands, yard work, all the stuff that falls on my plate I need to get done on the weekend because I work full time. All I can do is seeth and yell into the Internet void.

I've been up most of the last couple nights because we're keeping the dog confined to my room and he's not used to being secluded from our other dog so his restlessness keeps me up. So I'm running on fumes. I'm used to doing everything myself, I don't need his help and I'm usually patient with him and go out of my way to make sure he feels included in the house. But he always chooses the worse times to be pissy and have a bad attitude and make the whole house tense. And for once, FOR ONCE, all I need from him is to not make a situation worse. And he can't even do that for me. He's the kind of person that uses ""I'm just being honest"" as an excuse to be an asshole so he lets everything just fall out of his mouth with no consideration for anyone's feelings. So even if I asked him to just keep all of his negative feelings to himself for just a day or two so I could focus, he'd pick a fight with me about ""not feeling like he can be himself."" Like, bro, I'm not asking you to not tell me when you're feeling poorly, I'm your caregiver and I *need* to know that kind of stuff, I'm just asking for you 48 hours NOT to get on some sort of soap box about something you read on the Internet and how superior it makes you feel and how everyone is stupid but you! I internalize this stuff!

It's difficult to talk to anyone because people who aren't caregivers would just think of me as selfish for daring to suggest I need to have my feelings considered when my partner is dying and disabled. Trust me, I make myself feel bad enough about that as it is. But a person can be dying and disabled and still act like a selfish prick. It's not mutually exclusive. In fact, often more so because they have that excuse for their behavior and are able to get away with it more than someone able-bodied.

j5pocb,caregivers,HELP! Caregivers Don't Feel Safe in Client's Home,"  

I am an in-home caregiver in the US (specifically NC), that works the graveyard shift, and I‚Äôm looking for speedy advice. Here‚Äôs the situation:

Nearly all the caregivers that work in the home have had some negative (and at times frightening experience) with a male neighbor who just moved in next door.

One has reported seeing him peeking through a glass door, and has heard loud footsteps on the ramp leading to the back door. Another has been yelled at by this same neighbor on her way to shift change, but wasn‚Äôt able to make out what he said. This same caregiver reported a worrying phone call. She picked up the house‚Äôs landline telephone, and heard heavy breathing on the line before the caller hung up. I myself have never seen anything happen, but did hear loud gunfire that seemed to be very close. The most frightening thing to happen so far was the discovery of a window screen that had been partially popped out of the frame, with black scuff marks abound the edge that suggest the use of some sort of pry-bar.

All of these incidents have been reported to the agency, and to the family of the client. Both are in favor of increased safety measures, such as blackout curtains, and security lights, but are resistant to the idea of installing a security system or making a formal complaint to police.

Frankly, we are all scared shitless. We deserve to feel safe in the workplace, and in my opinion, the relatively low pay we receive is not worth the potential danger. We‚Äôve agreed amongst ourselves that something more needs to be done, but aren‚Äôt sure what to do. We worry that if we report the issue directly to police, we might face retaliation (we work for a small private agency that has no HR department, and from what I‚Äôve heard, caregivers have been re-assigned, or even terminated, for less).

Some caregivers have considered leaving, as the situation has gotten progressively worse. I don't want to leave my client - I've been with her for four years, and love her like my own grandmother - but I become anxious before work, and as the night goes on, every bump and rattle nearly gives me a panic attack. We have planned to make one more strong appeal to the owner of our agency to intercede with the family, but if this is not successful in producing effective action, what should we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/j5pocb/help_caregivers_dont_feel_safe_in_clients_home/,1601924884.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
hc10xk,caregivers,Suddenly primary c/g for FIL with dementia,"Hi, newcomer here. Very new - my sweet mother-in-law who was also my best friend passed away suddenly 2 weeks ago. My father-in-law (Pop) is disabled with a rebuilt shoulder, steel cage around his spine and having suffered numerous strokes - he also has dementia. We're very close and I currently work from home so it was natural for me to become his caregiver. Our permanent plan is for him to move in with us in NC, he's in VA right now. We will not be doing this quickly in order to not overwhelm him so for the time being I'm staying with him while my family is at our home and back to regular work.

Y'all this is so hard. I only just went back to work Tuesday, I have a pretty demanding full time job. His dementia is pretty mild, but he does require 24/7 care and supervision. Trying to work 8 hours and help him, take care of their dog, make sure he eats, takes medicine, doesn't wander off or try and take his truck and leave is just... a lot harder than I had hoped.

I've spent the last 3 days in an epic panic attack trying to keep everything up. The slightest thing will make me sob. I miss my friend and Momma. I know we will settle in more and it will get easier but I'm just so scared right now about how I will maintain an income and still take the best care of him and be his companion.

FOLLOWING NOTES FROM A BOOK



-Onset of depressive symptoms preceded much earlier, perhaps years than cognitive


impairment and memory problems




-Memory problems fairly sudden onset eg within 1 to 2 months of hospital admission october 2019 often



identifiable onset of cognitive impairment especially during and after hospital stay, which was definitely a shock as she never had to be hospitalized for so long and become so much dependent in life.




-Often emphasize inability to think,concentrate, and remember, especially when asked questions




-Signs and symptoms of depression include:




-loss of appetite.




-loss of interest in cooking, overseeing house cleaning and other chores she used to love.




-more silent




-less mobile or willingness to move




-less pain and discomfort tolerance probably and less temperature tolerance as evident by asking to switch on and off AC in short time




-much less patient than before




Much more 'i dont know' or 'not feeling well ' replies when trying to test cognition or memory

* SOMETIMES KEEP ASKING FOR BIPAP MASK EVEN WHEN SHE IS WEARING IT IN ANXIETY




MODERATELY APATHETIC, ESPECIALLY WHEN MORE ANXIETY




USED TO BE SELF SACRIFICINGLY CARING




NO SPECIFIC TIMES OF ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACKS, SO POSSIBLY NO SUNDOWNING




NO SPECIFIC TIMINGS OF SLEEP, CONTINUOUS SLEEP MAYBE ONLY 2 HOURS STRAIGHT, REST FRAGMENTED SLEEP. AVG DAILY SLEEP 3-4 HOURS.




FEELS MORE COLD THAN WARM ON AVG, ESPECIALLY PAST 3 MONTHS




NOT MUCH NEW TALK, MOST OF THE TIME REPEATED QUESTIONS OR COMPLAINS OR PHRASES




FEW DAYS SHE WHEN SHE DID GOT BETTER SLEEP EG 6-7 HRS, STILL SEEMED SAME




--------




***ON SOME DAYS SHE WAS VERY POSITIVE AND MOTIVATED Uncharacteristically.



ESPECIALLY 8 JUNE, SHE TRIED TO GETUP BURT COULDNOT DUE TO WEAKNESS BUT SHE WAS MOVING HER LEGS AND ARMS TO EXERCISE WHILE LYING. ALMOST WHOLE DAY SHE WAS VERY POSITIVE. COULD NOT TEST OR REMEMBER HOW HER MEMORY WAS. I WISH AND PRAY EVERDAY SHE BECOMES ATLEAST LIKE THAT.



14 JUNE ABT 70% OF 8TH JUNE



9TH JULY ABT 50% AND FOR FEW HOURS LIKE 5¬†



AFTERWARDS A FEW DAYS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT POSITIVE BUT NOT THAT MUCH AND ONLY FOR COUPLE OF HOURS




**SOCIALLY BAD BEHAVIOR WITH GUESTS SHE CHERISHED TO MEET AND LOVED EARLIER.¬†



EG HUSBAND OF HER FAVORITE SISTER CAME FROM KARACHI BUT SHE COULDNOT TURN FROM LEFT SIDE WHERE SHE FEELS LESS AGITATION TO RIGHT SIDE WHERE HE WAS SITTING EVEN FOR FEW SECONDS.




**MOBILITY WAS ACTUALLY NOT VERY MUCH SINCE 2 YEARS+, ESPECIALLY AFTER FATHER HAD TO BE ADMITTED IN HOSPITAL FOR 50 DAYS WHEN HE HAD MULTI STROKES AND DEMENTIA AND CPM CENTRAL PONTINE MYLOSIS AND RECOVERED FROM RECORD LOW SODIUM 101 COUPLE OF YEARS AGO




--++++++++++




MAIN REASON FOR LESS MOBILITY, SINCE 2 YEARS ESPECIALLY WAS EXTREME BACK PAIN AND BREATHLESSNESS, WEAKNESS. BUT NOW I THINK MENTAL/ MOOD DISORDER OR ILLNESS ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE ROLE.



EG SHE USED TO LOVE COOK AND LATER OVERSEE COOKING FOOD FOR ME AND FATHER, BUT AFTER FATHER HOSPITAL STAY AND RETURN SHE DIDNOT WANT TO.




SHE ALSO USED TO LOVE GOING TO NEARBY MART TO BUY MONTHLY GROCERIES WITH ME, BUT SINCE I THINK SEP 2018 SHE WAS UNABLE TO AND TOLD ME IT WAS DUE TO FATIGUE BREATHLESSNESS ETC.




SHE OFTEN LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY WEEP AND BECOME VERY EMOTIONAL WHEN I REFUSE TO DO A CERTAIN TASK DUE TO MY OWN FATIGUE




MIGHT HAVE HAD DELIRIUM WHEN AFTER T2RF CONDITION BECAME BETTER ON 31 JAN 20 AND SHIFTED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN NIGHT. SHE WAS WEEPING VERY MUCH AND COMPLAINING AND WAS NOT ACCEPTING ANYTHING AT ALL AND MUCH MORE RESTLESSNESS THAN USUAL. THAT CONDITION¬†



LASTED FOR SOME HOURS.




------------------




***SHE ASKS FOR DOCTOR HOME VISIT, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED EVEN WHEN FATHER WAS GRADE 20 OFFICER




***NOT MUCH SENSE OF TIME, YEAR OR MONTH




WAKES OR TRY TO WAKES FATHER AND ME BY CALLING OUR NAMES REPEATEDLY WHICH NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE HOSPITAL ADMIT




SOMETIMES SAYS PAIN IN WHOLE BODY BUT AFTER FEW MINS WHEN ASKED AGAIN SAYS ONLY ANXIETY




***ANXIETY OR PANIC ATTACKS LASTS TOO LONG, HOURS, THOUGH NOT TOO INTENSE SEEMINGLY, SUCH AS MOSTLY VERBAL COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT CALLING DR OR REPEATEDLY TELLING SHE HAS TOO MUCH ANXIETY SO CALL FAMILY DR ETC.




SOMETIMES SAY 30-40% SHE ASKS FOR SOMETHING TO EAT, BUT AFTER FEW MINS WHEN I BRING IT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN




---+----------




RARELY, WHEN SHE WAKESUP FROM A NAP SHE SEEMS SOMEWHAT POSITIVE FOR SOMETIME EG USE SPOON TO EAT ON HER OWN ETC

10zz7gu,caregivers,"IAmA 26 year old man and the only caregiver for my TBI mother after she had a ruptured brain aneurysm and now lives with a permanent brain shunt, in a foreign country living in intense finance stress while having to stay sane and positive for my mothers recovery after 3 brain surgeries.","I'm a 26 years old man born '96 and totally alone without family left in this country, I am the one and only caregiver and providing financial aid.

Last year June 2022 my life changed when my mothers friend she was visiting called and told my mother lost consciousness, we called an ambulance and in the ER they return to me saying he has a ruptured brain aneurysm.

At the time I was 25, so obviously for someone not working in the medical industry, I asked to explain what is going on in normal words.

He told me that bubble in your mothers brain that has been growing for 2 years which has now bursted and the amount / spreading of blood is large, the diagnosis is not good and survival rate is lower than 50%.

He gave me 1mg Temazepam after I fell down when I heard this, asked if I had someone to call me to pick me up and said they will bring her to another hospital and I shouldn't hear from them until tomorrow morning unless she does not survive the night.

My father divorced my mother behind her back in February 2022, which after he also has done a lot of ""lying and cheating"" financially wise on me, exploiting me while I was working with him, basically our relationship wasn't the best after he divorced my mother, married a girl from 1993 (I am 1996 as stated), he is from 1970, this girl always tried to provocate us to get in arguments and fights, as she did with sending dirty messages to my mother and working on her nerves.

That day even after all that, he is the only person I know in this country and he is my father, I ringed him when I sat on the hospital floor in tears, explained him what happened and begged to just pick me up and bring me home.

He was far away so I was waiting, I even thought maybe he wouldn't come, but he did. Instead of bringing me home, he invited me over to his place and we were only us two, drinking. We got wasted, crying and as me and my father both knew we use ""flakes"" on and off, so he asked me to order that. Now I think back it's disgusting but at the time I saw him as my best friend and we sat cried together and remembered stories about my mother, shared even sometimes laughed because she's such a positive human being.

He screamed all night saying ""God, please, take me but don't take ""Lisa"" - she's the last person who deserves this"", I see he stands up to go to the toilet and he is totally broken. I even hugged him after all our disagreements and said:

""Dad, if I ever knew you still love my mother so much, I would of had a different meanining of you a long time ago, but now I am shocked how much you care about her. I thought you never gave a shit.""

To which he responds:

""Son, I've been married to your mother for 26 years. What did you think?""

Well. Seemed as a tragedy at least gave back my father, nope. 3 days later as soon she is out of coma he buys a ticket to his home country, to visit his new wife which is 3 years older than me. He was away for one month and only answered when I texted. When I asked him 8 euro to buy cigarette, he sent me 8 euro, not even 10.

During that month my mother was in intensive care. I was always working with him and had my own income, but just as a disaster like this in my life happens, I no longer work with my father and my own income that I was generating has come to finish.

I needed a home to pay, mother to visit in intensive care every day and I need food to eat. I went to social services support to ask for any help I can get. I met a great person who helped me on the first day to provide me with social support, since the hospital also mentioned to the social service worker I currently survive on hospital food.

(They offered a meal each time I arrived and went home, it was such a blessing to get something simple like this and gave me hope for tomorrow to get through, this is coming from a person who always lived ""more expensive than average"".) They arranged a weekly food ticket in a church and set me up for a social program to get at least minimal survival wage but obviously I had to wait for review and approval, just so I could at least pay rent and survive. Pretty much just exist.

He knew I had nothing to eat. When I texted him a picture of the bag with food from the church stating the food is shit, he texted me well you're homeless what you want and the ""lmao"" smiley.

My mother is home since August 3, 2022 - I am the only caregiver and family member who also provides the only financial support.

I still live isolated with daily financial stress and caregiver stress. I am doing this post because I want to say everything as is without any lies, maybe I will get an idea how I should move on with my life, sometimes it feels I'm going insane.

I am debating on bringing my mother back to her home country where is her 74-year old mother and 41-year old sister because I can't stand it anymore. When social services asked me to ""keep track of my battery"" and told ""I see you're at 90% battery now - when you feel it drop below 50%, please speak to us. Now I understand what she meant, except I don't want social services to know what I am going through as I want anonimity.

It is a long story and I will edit the post on and off to add some details.

I am happy to answer all questions you may have, I have nobody to speak to but am open for a chat, to give someone else suggestions if you are going through something similar or if you want to know more about my situation or suggest me how to get my life back while not abandoning my mother as I will never do that.

Now, decades later, I'm still living with the financial consequences of lost wages during those years. I made up for it somewhat in the years following their deaths but still can never retire, mostly due to health care costs.

I lost the carefree days of dating and finding a partner.

I'm that age now, and I'm tired. I'm extremely depressed that I can never stop working and that in my old age, no one really gives  a damn about me. I worry I'll die homeless.

Like many people, I was so eager when I was young and my reality now breaks my heart and stresses me out constantly.

I feel like a bum for not having as much money as my retired ""friends,"" who are mostly couples.

She has seen a million doctors over the years and we still don't have a diagnosis. Some days the pain is so bad that she can barely get out of bed. The hardest times though are when it comes to making decisions about how to pursue further treatment. Because we don't have a diagnosis and there are so many theories about what could be ailing her, there isn't always a clear next step. Sometimes we disagree about what the next step should be and this can be quite stressful. She can have very strong opinions about what doctors she should see next and when, and sometimes I feel like she is making the wrong decision. I try to remind myself that in the end it is her decision how to best to pursue treatment, but I do get angry and frustrated. I sometimes don't want to tell her about my feelings because she is in so much pain and just so overwhelmed that she can't handle anything else. I don't keep my feelings from her usually, but sometimes I feel guilty that I'm frustrated with her because she is the one in pain and suffering so much. How do you all deal with these sorts of situations? Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1zgc6o/dealing_with_stress/,1393872003.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

It‚Äôs gotten progressively worse‚Äîshe quit her job, barely manages the house, and spends most of her time in bed. She‚Äôs mentioned several possible causes herself: dehydration, inner ear ‚Äúcrystals,‚Äù junk food, lack of exercise. But the level of dysfunction seems too severe for what sound like relatively minor issues.

She did have a full round of testing a few months ago that ruled out a vestibular disorder, but another doctor mentioned the possibility of MS based on her symptoms. Ten years ago, brain imaging showed early signs of dementia, but she got very angry with that doctor and dismissed it entirely. More recently, she received an ADHD diagnosis, which she now uses to explain things like forgetfulness, mental fog, or her inability to follow through with tasks. I‚Äôm not dismissing the ADHD diagnosis, but I worry that it's being used to ignore deeper health issues.

I‚Äôve tried bringing this up with her multiple times, gently and supportively, but she shuts me down saying it stresses her out. And I get it, she‚Äôs likely scared too. But I‚Äôm honestly terrified. At the rate she‚Äôs declining, I can see her needing long-term care in a couple of years, which is heartbreaking.

1m3i2oi,caregivers,5 affordable ways to keep your loved one entertained this summer,"
Hey Caregivers!

Summer can be a tough season. It's hot, routines can get disrupted, and it's easy to feel stuck at home. I wanted to share a few affordable, low-stress ideas to help you and your loved one to get out of the house and enjoy the season without breaking the bank or overdoing it. Hope this helps!

1. Museum Days 

Don't underestimate museums! Many have senior discounts, and some offer free admission on specific days of the week or for residents of the local county. Call ahead to check their accessibility options like elevators, ramps, and rentable wheelchairs. A quiet, air-conditioned art or history museum can be a wonderful and calm sensory experience.

2. Splash Pads Aren't Just for Kids 

This might sound unusual, but hear me out! Local parks often have free splash pads. For a loved one in a wheelchair or a seated rolling walker, this is a fantastic way to cool down and have some fun. The sound of the water and the happy shrieks of kids can be really uplifting. Pro-tip: Go during off-peak hours (like a weekday morning) to avoid major crowds. Don't forget sunscreen, a hat, and maybe some non-slip water shoes! Also a jacket for after in case they get chilled.

3. Your Local Library is a Goldmine!

Libraries are more than just books! Many library systems have programs that offer free or significantly reduced-price tickets to local attractions like zoos, botanical gardens, and historical sites. Ask the librarian about ""culture passes"" or ""museum passes."" It's one of the best-kept secrets for affordable entertainment.

4. Find Local Festivals & Fairs Online

Check websites like Groupon, Eventbrite, or even Facebook Events. You can often filter your search for ""free"" or ""low-cost"" events in your area. I've found everything from small craft fairs and classic car shows to free community festivals this way. It‚Äôs a great way to feel connected to the community without a huge commitment.

5. Evening Concerts & Movies in the Park 

Many towns and cities host free outdoor concerts or movie nights in a local park during the summer. While they might be geared towards families, the atmosphere is usually relaxed and joyful. Bring some comfortable folding chairs, a blanket, some favorite snacks, and enjoy a pleasant evening out. Check your city's Parks and Recreation website for a schedule.

What are some of your favorite affordable summer outings? Would love to hear more ideas!

The place he is renting with his savings/SSI is about to be sold (they have to, I don't blame them).  I've been looking into a nursing home type situation for him for a while.  He would flourish if forced to be around other people and had a daily nudge to take medication, shower, and eat properly.

My Dad‚Äôs cognitive decline started about a year ago (mostly memory and word recall). After back surgery in February, he had two car accidents (the second serious but no injuries). Since then, he‚Äôs been living with my family (wife, two teenage sons, dog, and cat ‚Äî plus two full-time work-from-home jobs).



He now has suspected Alzheimer‚Äôs (MRI showed brain bleeding). He needs full med management, sees things that aren‚Äôt there, and struggles with daily activities. We tried home therapy for a few weeks, but that ended and no clear next steps were given. He‚Äôs sleeping on our couch because there‚Äôs no space elsewhere, and our home feels overwhelmed.



He just started Donepezil and will likely add an antidepressant soon. He‚Äôs financially stable but doesn‚Äôt think he needs any help and resists talking about the future.



**If you‚Äôve been here, how did you figure out the next steps?** I feel stuck between not wanting to abandon him and knowing this isn‚Äôt sustainable long-term.



Thanks so much for any advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1k3eo1c/caring_for_my_dad_after_alzheimers_symptoms_and_a/,1745123845.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

i4o64s,caregivers,Need advice for a man trying to get a woman with alzheimer's to do her personal care.,"In my current placement, I handle the husband with vascular  dementias needs, while a female carer handles the wife with alzheimer's needs, but the new carer after the last one left is useless, I've contacted our manager and the NOK telling them she needs to be replaced ASAP,  the service user hasn't washed or changed clothes for 4 days now. She has hemorrhoids and wears a pad which also hasn't been changed for that time, I can't wait for another carer, I need to get this done today. I can get her to take her medication, which the female carer tries to do once and gives up, but she typically doesn't respond to men trying to help her with personal care. 

She handles her own personal care, but she was a teacher, and responds better to childlike personalities asking her to do things, which I can't do, the husband responds better to polite, intelligent professionals, which is why I work well for him, but not so much his wife. That's not a character I could put on, and if I tried, it would be uncomfortable for everybody. The last carer hasn't responded to my messages,  I was hoping her advice could help me handle this myself. 

For context, the new carer, forgot to order medication after being told no less than 5 times that she needs to the day the last carer left, tries for less than a minute to get through to the wife and gives up, I do all of the cooking and shopping, literally all she does is clean, and ask once or twice for the wife to handle personal care, take medication, or change clothes. I'm taking the reigns as much as possible so that her needs are met, but I've just been trying my best to encourage the other carer to keep trying to get the wife to handle her personal care and change clothes. She's an old fashioned lady, so a man trying to get her to change clothes makes her uncomfortable. 

Any advice that could help, or ways to handle this, if you've had a similar experience would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I've ordered the medication myself and asked them to put an urgent on it, but she is going to miss her sleeping pills tonight at least, if the surgery hasn't put it through urgently, she won't have any until Monday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/i4o64s/need_advice_for_a_man_trying_to_get_a_woman_with/,1596703604.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

1h1c4um,caregivers,My mom has dementia and she(we) are freaking out! I almost shot my landlord!,"I had just finished cleaning up dinner and I went outside to relax on my porch swing. It was after dark and I had a spotlight and a gun(pellet gun) with me. We have been having bobcat attacks on our chickens. I heard something coming out of the treeline behind the chicken coop and rabbitry. I armed myself and grabbed the spotlight. And caught a person coming out of the woods with a bag. I couldn't see who it was. I yelled at them to get leave, then realized how scared I was and ran inside to get a different gun(9mm), but I started having a small seizure. 
When I got inside everyone who heard me yelling was startled. My husband who got hurt at work a few days before stopped me and grabbed the spotlight and hobbled outside(he was on pain meds so he was able to move around a little). He called the landlord to let them know there was a trespassers and he said ""ok"" and hung up on my husband. From were we were standing we could see the person running down a blackberry vine filled field before they laid down to hide. Then my husband got a call from the landlords wife saying ""it me turn light.""(no typos...she doesn't speak very good English, she is south Korean)
He asked her what she was doing sneaking around she said ""I collect plants for Buddhist blessing over property."" My husband was like ""I'm Buddhist! You should have asked me I would have helped! Instead you scared my wife! What if she had had another granmaul seizure? ""
My bedbound stepmom who has PTSD is freaking out! They had all the window shades open. We are backed up against the wood so they don't normally feel worried about getting changed in front of the windows. They are already trying to move out since the landlords wife screamed at my dad when he told her she needs to give us 24hr notice.
My mom(whom also lives with us) with dementia was panicking the rest of the night she wore her shoes to bed ""incase they bust in to hurt us I can run away"".

192yfjx,caregivers,Much needed rant (F 29) caring for elderly father (83) with Parkinsons & Dementia," I feel like very few people if any understand the toll caring for elderly parents has on a person. The lack of support we have. I feel so irritated by this inescapable feeling of responsibility for my dad's well being and it's only gotten worse all my life as he ages with parkinsons and dementia at 83 (I'm 29 and have been caring for him and my mom before I was even 18 - mom is younger tho). The overwhelm to control and fix everything for everyone. To feel guilty as hell to enjoy and life my life to the best of my abilities. The fact that I have siblings and they do NOTHING.  Like no one takes care of me when I need someone and it just makes me cry. Dating has been hard for me, school has been, my own health. I feel so effing alone. People don't understand the tremendous amount of responsibility. I feel so suffocated and I can't just leave caring for them  for many reasons. I feel so different than most my age. This type of lifestyle and trauma changed me. Understanding my life, my cards are heavy. I've carried the weight of being my fathers keeper before I was even emotional or psychologically equipped to. Trying to rehabilitate myself in society since all I've know is caring for both parents. Idk how i can even relate to people my age. It's fucking heart breaking because I still feel like a kid at heart but I had to grow up so fast and there's no one but me. And I worked hard to love my own company but dammit I crave connection too. To be seen and helped and supported. But most don't relate. They will eventually but not where it's taken their youth.

Sighs. Gotta keep on keeping on. I never thought I'd wave a white flag over being my dad's care giver but this is hurting me too much to do this day to day care. For so many reasons it's not fulfilling. And regardless I'll always have that responsibility anyways but I think reducing it as much as I can eventually will suffice as I can actually venture out into the world as I finish school slowly. 

Actually believe in living my life for me as a person with needs of her own, dreams, and a rewarding possibility of my own family one day.

Idk, does anyone relate to this overwhelm?  To the burn out ? The lack of understanding of our day to day lives ? The turmoil of emotions that comes with our parents aging

He does some things as though he has Autism or OCD (he doesn't do well with change and when he's done brushing his teeth, he does a specific tapping pattern on the sink each time).

Things start getting fuzzy for her then. (That was before we got her into AL.) She's basically having oodles of trouble making new memories. Hard to predict whether something will stick. Like she knows the names of her CNA's at the AL facility, despite having only met them in the last few months.

1j6whlq,caregivers,My aunt keeps implying I'm not doing enough for my mother," My mother has been suffering from some form of dementia for the past 5+ years. I've discussed the memory loss with her primary physician who's said she's too young to be having alzheimers (she's 55 now, and the physician has been saying this since 3+ years ago). I've gotten her scheduled with a neurologist around 2-3 years ago and the neurologist said something similar, and ordered a ct scan and another appointment. I talked to my mother about it at the time, and she said that she didn't want to keep going because she really didn't want a diagnosis/prognosis looming over her head. I respected her decision and cancelled the appointment, because I want give my mother the dignity of deciding things for herself.

Now, my mom's condition has gotten worse, where she has trouble focusing in a conversation, talks with people who aren't there, and isn't sure where she is at times. My aunt (my mom's sister) has been implying that I haven't been doing enough to get my mother cured, and that if she just got prescribed medicine or something, my mother will return to normal. She's also been saying this for years. I already suffer from low self esteem and have been struggling to take care of my mother while living my life as well, and feel that I'm behind my peers in life, and to hear this from someone so close to me makes me feel angry and sad. My aunt has even said that I should have lied to my mom and went ahead with the appointments, and not told my own mom. As far as I'm aware, there really isn't a way to reverse this kind of disease, and I'm tired of feeling like the punching bag when it comes to mother.

The rest of my mother's siblings haven't really stepped up, and my dad brushed off my concerns from the beginning. My mother's friends also did something similar. And now my aunt is saying shit like this and it makes me want to curl up into a ball.

1i7enyz,caregivers,Am I wrong to be upset with OT for ignoring my question and reinforcing a safety risk?,"I originally posted this is AIO but I think it‚Äôs better here, as I need people with an understanding of the nuances of the situation. I‚Äôm gonna try to give back story to make this make sense but not write a novel.

I (36F) work as an in home caregiver for an 84F patient with early signs of dementia who is a fall risk who doesn‚Äôt believe or remember she‚Äôs a fall risk. She‚Äôs had several bad falls in the last few years and couple since I started this summer (only 1 minor fall in my care). She is a stubborn spitfire of a woman and I adore her. We are highly irreverent together and I‚Äôm her favorite caregiver because I read her mind and I don‚Äôt sugar coat things.

Anyway she had a bad fall early November which caused a compression fracture in her spine. This is at least the second time this has happened in the last 1.5 years. She was completely unable to move on her own for about 3 weeks and it was rough for everyone. Recovery has been slow but steady with a few hiccups. She has been receiving in home physical therapy (pt) and occupational therapy (ot) since.

We love her pt. He is amazing and gets her. We don‚Äôt love her ot. We‚Äôve had a few problems with him, firstly being him coming in and telling her to smile, that she‚Äôs so pretty when she smiles and kept on it when she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need to smile all the time‚Äù I could tell she was uncomfortable and chimed in that ‚Äúnot everyone is in a good mood all the time and it‚Äôs okay to not always smile‚Äù he doubled down and was basically regurgitating toxic positivity. I was able to redirect and move on. But it really bothered my lady. She perseverated on it. The next time he came back I was in a bit of a salty mood already and he said it and I‚Äôll admit my tone was harsher than I meant but I straight up told him (paraphrasing) ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that, don‚Äôt tell women to smile. It‚Äôs uncomfortable and it‚Äôs not actually about whether or not we are happy it‚Äôs about the male gaze and how we are supposed to appear for others. Not every day is a good day and it‚Äôs okay to not put on a show. Don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù He kind of doubled down a bit somewhere in the middle but by the end of my rant he said he didn‚Äôt realize it was a thing for women and he wouldn‚Äôt do it anymore. And he hasn‚Äôt. 

My lady still doesn‚Äôt like him. He holds her hand and she just doesn‚Äôt like the way he talks to her or makes her feel. For the most part I can usually deflect and he honestly is a nice guy and means well. He‚Äôs older, probably 50‚Äôs and a very jovial person. I think it‚Äôs how he deals, by being positive but you have to be able to adapt your bedside manner to your clients.

As I mentioned my lady is stubborn and dealing with memory loss so it‚Äôs hard to know what drives some of the behavior. Regardless she is prone to getting up and wandering without her walker any time she thinks she can get away with it. And she‚Äôs sneaky. A big bone of contention is her bedside commode, she would rather use the toilet. I get it, I really do. But she has fallen so often in the night on the way to the toilet it is just not safe. So we‚Äôve stopped using it unless we are already in the bathroom. It‚Äôs also way less safe for us as caregivers to support her in there because it‚Äôs small and we can‚Äôt be in with her we have to lean in from the door so it puts our bodies in the wrong position for safe support. This gets harder when she has spent time at her kids houses because she uses the toilet, gets back in that habit and we have to readjust to the commode all over.

Which is exactly what happened this weekend. I was off and she was with her daughter and the other caregiver. Other caregiver reported she made it all the way to the bathroom no walker in the night walking right past the commode. This is a safety issue. She can‚Äôt fall again especially while her back is still healing from the last break. But also just no more falls.

Fast forward to today. Ot comes, I ask about getting some ideas about how to keep up with brushing teeth without having to go into the bathroom and stand at the sink. He takes her into the bathroom and has her practice getting in and out of toilet room and on/off toilet. We get into a bit of an argument in front of patient because I say (paraphrasing) ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt helpful, the other caregiver and I agree that keeping consistency with the commode is in her best interest for safety. It‚Äôs confusing for her to use the toilet because it causes problems in the night and she doesn‚Äôt remember not to use the toilet. We are struggling with her making choices to keep herself safe and this isn‚Äôt what we need help with.‚Äù He tells me ‚Äúots don‚Äôt work with commodes and this is what he needs to see. That this is the goal and this is important for his assessment‚Äù (she has just had assessments from other ots he‚Äôs just supposed to follow the plan). We go back and forth a bit as I‚Äôm trying to explain to him about her wandering and safety and how I asked about brushing teeth not toileting. I was frustrated and felt like he didn‚Äôt listen at all. We were able to redirect and finish the session but he never helped with any solutions around brushing teeth. 

I spoke with the other caregiver and pt later this evening because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was overreacting and there was something I was missing. But I‚Äôm actually more upset having talked it out with them.

1eah83c,caregivers,HELP !!! How do you deal with confabulation ? ,"TL:DR

If you read this thank you.

My father has always been lovely, calm, caring and very wise, during good and bad times. Never controlling or manipulative. Also, he never had any speech/hearing/memory issues before. All symptoms started when he was 55 yo:

Memory loss;

Mixing memories / events / words and then talking about untrue facts / false accusations;

Bad articulated sentences without common sense;

Unaware of his inappropriate words;

Unaware of his speech/language impairment;

Ask same questions over and over again;

Forgetting keys / dates / appointments / where he places objects;

Can't understand anything or understands the opposite of what we say;

Changing plans every 5 minutes because he forgets what he was supposed to do before;

Saying something different about a topic every 5 minutes;

Getting defensive / feeling shocked when we talk about his behaviour because he doesn't remember anything;

The most disturbing aspect of his behaviour is mixing events/memories/ words and talking about untrue facts / false accusations.

Here some examples when he's not in his right mind:

When people talk, strangers included, he feels threatened without any reason and gets defensive. When he is driving he uses inappropriate words towards strangers. During his dark moments he can't understand anything people say and can't speak normally like he used to do before his decline. He forgets things to do after 5 minutes. Once he accused a clerk of spying on him and began to complain. Another time he made some stupid jokes in front of another employee. During an argument he said something inappropriate to a neighbor. Even in front of doctors he can't explain himself well and gets nervous. Sometimes he forgets dates, where are objects, ask the same things over and over again, and when he pays bills.

He said that me and mother hate him, that it would be better without his presence (you know what I mean).When we talk he feels threatened by us and says that we accuse him of things he never did, making things up to make him feel bad. Also she brainwashes me.During a conversation at home he said my mother told a boy to throw himself into the street and d*e. She was like WTF!? He once told me that my mother was sick because I didn't make her stop smoking, but actually she was having a completely different and unrelated health problem. There is no common sense here. How can a person be responsible for others? When he was sane (before his cognitive decline) the whole family talked about quitting, without any issues or misunderstanding. The list goes on...

During mental clarity moments (very few), after we explain the situation, he trusts us and feels sorry. He doesn't remember anything, he feels there's something wrong but can't understand what is happening and why. He's not aware of his condition and what people see/hear from him. 

He has diabetes 2, high pressure and fat liver. During the years he was prescribed memory supplements/vitamins but they didn't work. We've tried to talk about his symptoms with his new family doctor and she clearly said there's no need to do anything because my father can still drive, gardening or paying bills. They do something only when a patient is not self succient anymore or becomes violent. So his behaviour is not concerning for her.

Many people have told me about dementia here on reddit and I agree with them. We'll search another doctor and ask a second opinion ASAP.

141gqyg,caregivers,Looking for advice before making a big decision,"Hello. This is a LONG one, be warned.

I came here for advice since I know almost nothing about what it's like to care for aging relatives, which I am considering as of this morning. 

tldr: should I move countries to care for beloved relatives who need help, to keep them out of an independent living institution

EDIT: Your comments are so helpful. I have have talked with my uncle and other relatives who are invested. It looks like it‚Äôs happening but in a few months so now my project will be planning logistics and preparing myself mentally, especially thinking about comments on carving out personal time and taking care of myself as well.

&#x200B;

The relatives: 

my great aunt and uncle (youngest bro of my maternal gma, and his wife) we'll call them Uncle Willie and Aunt Flora. They are in their 70's and childless. I love them very much, and aside from some holidays, when I was younger my sister and I got the chance to stay with them at least once a year for a week or two at a time, in a major US city in a different state from where we grew up. As an adult I went to see them when I could but it's been a while. They have always had a special affection for us and I think were the only people I knew growing up who cared about things like composting, protest, mysticism, they had lesbian artist friends when I didn't know any... my mom calls them granola hippies but their lifestyle had a huge impact on me that I'm really grateful for. They have lived in the same house for many decades where they have cats and a garden and close relationships with their neighbors. Across the street from their house there is a small forested park, that my uncle is a voluntary caretaker for and that he along with other neighbors helped resuscitate in the late 90's.

&#x200B;

Their situation: 

Aunt Flora struggles with depression since retiring from her meaningful non-profit job and is living since a couple years with a degenerative brain condition that means that she is still mostly her bubbly self but with severe short term memory loss and a short fuse and impulsive decision making, and needing a certain amount of supervision and care such as driving to appointments, keeping track of meds and accompaniment to the store. When things got bad, several relatives including my grandma and I came to stay with them at different brief times but it seemed to be more of a burden rather than helpful. Since then Uncle Willie, who is a retired community college professor, has been taking care of Flora alone and while he loves her he seems to resent the arrangement and often loses his patience. While we don't really know the cause yet, it looks like the stress and physical toll of taking everything on for himself is what led to him suffering from two strokes in the past few weeks. So now he can't drive either and is relying on neighbors for that, and he's a bit disabled in other ways but this scare has got my mom and a few other relatives trying to get him to admit that he needs help. They are now reluctantly considering moving into some kind of independent living home, but not immediately.

&#x200B;

My situation: 

I (25f) have been living in another country since 2 years pursuing a masters degree, I'm almost done with the thesis (hopefully done in a month) and my student visa is up in the end of October. I have been planning to renew it for another year (a looking for work visa they have for recent grads) while looking for a job contract and was hoping to stay in the same city to maintain some stability. The last year has been rough, I really can't say I'm happy or enjoying life and certainly have not been enthusiastically looking forward to whatever comes next, I'm burnt out from school and work and feel pretty useless and lonely, even though I do have friends here and a caring partner. My roommate and I have been in our apt for 6 months and I put in a lot of work to make it a nice and cozy place to live, but still don't really feel at home here. Also for background, my work experience includes mostly service industry and childcare including being a live-in nanny.

&#x200B;

The factors 

The idea we have of US institutions for independent and senior living conditions are being fairly bare bones while astronomically expensive when you don't have good insurance which they don't, and they need different levels of care so that limits options for them to stay together. I realized that I can't bear to think about them having to sell their house and leave their cats, garden, neighbors, park, for a place that would probably be understaffed and filled with strangers, especially since they are so young and active still. If they are open to permanent help from the family then I am probably the right person because I'm used to moving around, new cities/countries, being far from loved ones, I genuinely enjoy being at home cooking and doing household tasks especially when it's appreciated, I am in a transition period without clear goals for what's next, and most importantly I think I would be happy to care for people who I feel a lot of love and gratitude for and get along with well. I'm worried about the uncertainty but I really feel that if I didn't propose this while I'm available, I would regret it later on. My roommate thinks I shouldn't ""give up my life"", but I can't stop thinking that this a chance to give back to people who have spent their lives in service to their community. Plus I already know that I feel comfortable in their environment and city and they have a spare room. However, the whole process of moving back to the US and whatever paperwork is involves seems exhausting.

&#x200B;

There are other important factors that I don't know about, like their exact financial situation and the exact timeline of when I'd start and how long it could be for (maybe a long time since they are still relatively young and healthy), what daily life with them would be like. Haven't talked to other family members, since I don't want to put it out there until I'm 100% sure that I would go through with it. I do not know whether they would accept my proposition or not, which I don't want to underestimate but my mom and I feel that they would be extremely relieved to have this kind of solution.

&#x200B;

So what do you all think? What would you do? What is it really like being a live-in caregiver for relatives who will likely need more care over time, and has anyone regretted making such a decision out of love?

I've been on 5mg hydrocodone 2-4 a day for a while. Lately been more like since in trying to conserve them while we see if Gabapentin does anything which it appears it is not working.

Just been in a lot of pain. Feels like a pool ball being shoved up my butt for hours every day. Hard to focus. Sometimes have stabbing and burning pains which are likely from the seton or a new fistula that has formed.

Really frustrated and not confident I'm going to get my pain managed well by colorectal surgeon or PCP or GI. The surgeon was hesitant to want to refill my last 30 pill script saying my pain is more chronic now than acute. My PCP seems hesitant and wanted to try gabapentin. I have another appointment this week with my surgeon and one with my PCP in three weeks. Don't see my GI again until July.

Hoping my last two pills can hold me over a few days :(

hgs343,ChronicPain,Could my chronic pain be caused by gastritis/IBD?,"Long story short: neuropathy in feet, muscle spasms in my abdomen and in general the left side of my body feels discomfort when it flares up, from my toes all the way to my head. It feels like the entire left side of my body is being thrown out of whack, even my brain and shoulder muscles. This is probably caused by my abdominal muscles contracting uncontrollably on my left side (which my chiropractor noticed), throwing my whole body out of balance and causing severe discomfort/pain.

I've seen every doctor and specialist under the sun, none of them know what's going on. The MRI I thought was of my abdomen was actually of my lower spine, and while my spine looks good, it basically says nothing about my intestines.

I've had gastritis twice before in my life. When the pain flares up bad, I seem to lose my sense of hunger and feel like I'm a bit bloated on my left side, almost like I want to burp but I have nothing to burp up. I also have issues with diarrhea occasionally. Seems like once every couple of weeks or so, if not more frequent.

At this point I have to be very selective with any doctor visits I make trying to figure this out because I've wasted so much money over the past 4 and a half years trying to figure out what's causing this. At this point this is really my only lead left, just about everything else including cancer has been ruled out by process of elimination.

I am falling MINIMUM two times a day, and that‚Äôs while actively trying not to fall. I‚Äôm bruised all over my body. The pain gets so severe, my legs just give out.

Plus I was told a Biologic is less likely to work if you‚Äôve been on it before, due to your body developing antibodies to it). 

What should I do?

1kswcxp,ChronicPain,I Don't Think I Will Ever Have An Answer.,"Hi all,

This is a bit of a rant but also would love to hear any thoughts about what could be going on -- please don't say anything about gut dysbiosis/microbiome, food allergies/sensitivies etc. I have gone down this winding and inconclusive path before and I want real medical answers. 

  
I am a 24 year old woman and have not gone a day without stomach pain for 5 years. When I was 19, in my freshman year of college, I started developing heartburn after taking a Z-Pac (Azythromycin) for a sinus infection as well as 3 doses of a low-dose of Prednisone for swelling. Looking back, I wish I had never taken the steroid but hindsight is 20/20. Regardless, I began experiencing heartburn and some other strange bodily sensations -- dizziness, nausea, general 'off' feeling. I told my mom about the heartburn, and she recommended me to her GI Doctor, who prescribed me to take some Pepcid as needed...well, 'as needed' turned into 5+ times a day, so he put me on a PPI instead, Protonix or Nexium or something. After I took the PPI course, my heartburn was not better and I started to have terrible GI symptoms -- what I still describe today as 'searing' stomach pain, severe bloating, changes in bowel habits and chronic nausea. From that point on, I tried everything: colonoscopy/endoscopy was unremarkable and ruled out Crohn's/Colitis/Celiac..I later also had a pill-cam study done that DEFINITIVELY ruled out any type of IBD or Celiac. The GI Doc DX'd me with IBS and sent me on my way. Thanks!

  
Then I decided to see a functional medicine doctor. She put me on a bunch of natural supplements, including something called Candibactin. A stool sample she ran revealed that my microbiome was all messed up -- lots of bad bacteria and no good was her explanation -- but again, I am less convinced by this school of thought surrounding chronic stomach pain so if you are here to try and convince me that I simply didn't take enough probiotics or eat enough yogurt, just don't say anything ty :)

  
Down this rabbit hole of alternative medicine, I also drank a tea that an herbalist brewed for me for around 8 months, which did nothing. Other diagnoses I've received: one test I took came back positive for strongyloides parasite, which was very odd because I have never been to South America and don't spend much time in infected dirt. Lol. Think this was BS, I took Ivermectin and it did absolutely nothing. No other doctor ever suspected/saw a parasite in my results. I have tested negative for all food allergies and for Celiac disease. As of now, I still eat gluten and dairy free since they are more inflammatory foods, I avoid spicy things and carbonated drinks because they do hurt my stomach more. I also eat fish but not meat.

  
The reason that I'm writing this at all is because I got a glimmer of hope recently when I saw a post on TikTok about MALS and SMAS syndrome, essentially the narrowing of GI tract blood-supplying arteries that can cause severe stomach pain, bloating and nausea. Well I just got my CT scan with contrast results and I'm negative. No stenosis of my arteries and nothing of note within my GI tract.

  
So I'm back to square one again. 5 years in, this is my new normal but that doesn't mean it gets any less painful or life-interrupting to deal with. I know that I am not the only young woman with these issues and I'm so sick of hearing that I will 'outgrow' it or frankly insulting suggestions like gaining weight, working out more or going to therapy (I do, and I am on antidepressant medication).

  
Feel free to commiserate with me in the comments lol, or if you have some magical idea that I haven't thought of yet, feel free to shout it out.

1g0gl7t,ChronicPain,Tired of not having a diagnosis ,"Hello, I just need to complain a bit 
I have abdominal pain. It all started with constipation, and my GP kept giving me the wrong things. I went to a GI, Who told me I'm constipated cause I talk too much (really,). I then went to another GI, who is a very good doctor. I did lots of tests, some are positive but not enough to have a proper diagnosis. I did find something that works for my constipation. And yet the pains just gets stronger and gets more often. And I don't know what's causing it. 

It doesn't seem to be IBS, IBD, allergies, celiac or the liver. But I don't know what it is. My intestines are inflamed, I'm in pain all the time, and I don't even have a painkiller I can take. 

I now have one medication that could help but also might make my constipation to come back. 
She gave e more tests, but at this point I don't believe something will come up.

I just wish I hade more serious symptoms. Like something that would have to make me go to the er, or finding blood in my stools or something. It would definitely be worse, but at least I'd get a diagnosis faster. I'm also doing everything privately, which is expensive, cause my gp didn't believe I needed a specialist so.

1cphma9,ChronicPain,Rant... Chronic Headaches and Now Maybe Crohns,"I have been suffering with chronic headaches for the past 4 years and whenever I feel like I have a grasp on them they and get them under control they go sideways again. 

Now for the past few months I have been having gut pains and have been going through a number of tests to figure out what it is. I have a family history of Crohns Disease and it seems like my pain is now being norrowed down to perhaps being that. I don't really think you should have more than one chronic pain issue, it's not fair!

I'm 40 years old and falling apart!! People asking be how I'm doing and I say slowing dying. They laugh and say we are all slowing dying and I tell them I am slowly dying faster then them. I have a 44 year old co-working who rode his e-bike 17km to work the other day, I can barely make it through my day without pain killers. I have a car project I had to give up on and send to a shop cause I couldn't work on it due to fatigue and pain after work.

Today I've been diagnosed with Crohn's disease (albeit not the usual symptoms). But confirmed through a scope and biopsy.

From what I've read Crohn's is highly correlated with a simultaneous autoimunne condition of the joints. The onset of my back pain and gastric issues were almost simultaneous so I think its likely that they're linked.

So this is promising. Once I've sorted out my Crohn's medicines, back to the rheumatologist",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/11s34s8/progress_maybe_crohns/,1678901381.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I ended up having 8 teaspoons of coffee in a shaker three times a day. When I finally quit espressos, I had severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. My wife thinks the coffee caused my condition, which could be true. I also had a very bad diet of junk food and takeaways.

1kkb5sz,ChronicPain,Chronic Pain - No diagnosis seeking help,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm posting in the hope that someone out there has had a similar experience or can offer some insight. I‚Äôm 26M now, and have been dealing with a progressive, disabling pain condition that no one has been able to properly diagnose, despite years of medical investigation.

**Symptoms:**

* Chronic SI joint Pain (limping)
* Chronic Thoracic Spine pain
* Chronic Eye pain (pain using screens/photosensitivity)
* Chronic Tendon pain (wrists and knees)
* Chronic foot pain (Plantar pain)
* It feels like I‚Äôm living in a body that breaks down from even small amounts of stress‚Äîespecially tendons and connective tissues. Inflammation isn‚Äôt showing up on tests, but it feels systemic.

**Family History**

* Mums dad has ulcerative colitis
* My brother has ulcerative colitis
* Cousin being investigated for Ankylosing Sponylitis due to sacrum pain & inflamation

**Symptoms Timeline:**

* Started at age 15 with a shoulder injury that developed into thoracic spine pain.
* Through my teens and twenties, I experienced ongoing upper back pain and a right knee issue, somewhat managed with physiotherapy.
* At age 24, I developed severe lower back pain (near the right SI joint) after skateboarding. Ever since, I‚Äôve had difficulty walking and sometimes limp.
* Upper back pain worsened dramatically, to the point of becoming disabled and needing to move back in with my parents.
* Developed chronic tendon pain in my wrist from using a grip strengthener‚Äînow persistent for 1.5 years and unresponsive to rest or physiotherapy.
* Neuropathic like eye pain using computer / sensitivity to lights, though exams have been clear.
* It feels like my tissue tolerance is abnormally low‚Äîeven mild strain leads to injury that takes forever (or never) to heal.

**Tests Done:**

* MRI of entire spine + SI joints: No inlammation or damage.
* Bloodwork: Negative for HLA-B27, CRP, ESR, RF, ANA, etc.
* Eye exams: Mild Dry eye (pain doesn't reflect severity)
* Multiple rounds of physiotherapy: No help, often worsens pain.

According to ChatGPT, it could be:

* Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)
* Seronegative enthesitis-related arthritis
* Possibly autoimmune connective tissue conditions that don‚Äôt neatly fit any box

But I don‚Äôt meet the ‚Äúlab or imaging criteria,‚Äù so rheumatologists dismiss it.

Has anyone else experienced:

* Tendon/enthesis pain that doesn‚Äôt show up on MRI?
* Negative HLA-B27 but clear SpA-like symptoms?
* Normal CRP/ESR despite chronic pain?

Any advice, insight, or shared experiences would mean a lot. I‚Äôm exhausted trying to push through this without answers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1kkb5sz/chronic_pain_no_diagnosis_seeking_help/,1746996999.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1l8ixw8,ChronicPain,Severe abdominal pain - seeking advice or those experiencing the same symptoms,"I‚Äôve had a CT with & w/o contrast, abdominal MRI, pelvis and abdominal ultrasound, stool sample, bloodwork, and colonoscopy‚Ä¶ all came back normal. An ovarian cyst not to big was seen on CT. Provider said Crohn‚Äôs and ulcerative colitis were ruled out in colonoscopy (they took biopsy to also double check) I have had this for 2-3 years now and nothing helps. I mainly have pain all around in my lower abdomen/pelvic regions. I sometimes only pass mucus, without any stool. Sometimes it looks like I pass tissue pieces recalls. I have mucus in every bowel movement. I feel like I‚Äôm never fully empty. The pain is never relieved by bowel movements, and I have horrible tenesmus during these episodes. The mucus is sometimes wrapped around stool & sometimes I have pencil stools. The pain is so severe and I am stuck in the bathroom for hours. The mucus ranges in color constantly, the majority of the time it‚Äôs either completely clear mucus or yellowish/orangish or brownish mucus. But it‚Äôs also been blood tinged and even green before. The doctors can‚Äôt figure out what it is. I have diarrhea & constipation sometimes.

I‚Äôm a female in mid 20‚Äôs, currently taking SLYND birth control & Escitalopram (Lexapro), but the pain & mucus began before I started the Lexapro. I also take vitamin D. I‚Äôve recently started taking famotidine and Zyrtec daily. 

I have a history of ovarian cysts, vitamin D deficiency, factor 5 Leiden (clotting disorder), dysmenorrhea, one kidney stone as a teenager, an inguinal hernia repair as a toddler.

Since most things have been ruled out, all that I can think of is endometriosis? I haven‚Äôt had a laparoscopy procedure. Has anyone had these symptoms & gotten a laparoscopy that confirmed endometriosis?
- also has anyone had their Endo surgically removed/burned and if so did it help resolve these symptoms?
- I‚Äôm located in the southeast region of US and willing to travel, but I‚Äôm desperate for a treatment and some answers. This pain is occurring on average 5 days a week and this is so miserable. 

Please want help/advice from those with medical knowledge on this or previous experience with these symptoms or endometriosis please comment and let me know your advice and story. ",https://i.redd.it/0ytv6psuz76f1.jpeg,1749613715.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1hi8sat,ChronicPain,doctors who blame pain on anxiety ,"
Im so frustrated at this agreement in the medical community that if you cant figure out the cause of pain it is anxiety. they wont give you a diagnosis without proof. However there is no proof when it comes to anxiety related pain so why do they ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù you with that because its not life threatening. I feel like ive been manipulated by doctors to hid my pain from the world. They do an ekg its normal so its anxiety. I go to another doctor they do another ekg its normal so is anxiety. My pain continues to get worse year after year for six years. Until im at the point i am now. Where im basically bedbound due to the pain yet its still just anxiety. I need money to support myself so i work. And today i ignored my pain to the point I could barely breathe i could feel my bones cracking, the room is spinning peoples voices are getting louder and quiet. im in and out of consciousness and the room is spinning. Yet the first thing the doctor asks is if i have anxiety. The do yet another fucking ekg and determine i have fucking anxiety. It feels an awful lot like theyre calling me ‚Äúa woman with hysteria‚Äù. 

i also think its ridiculous that when someone does get a serious diagnosis the first thing they say is ‚Äúwhy were you ignoring these symptoms for so long‚Äù maybe because a lot of times the diagnosis of ‚Äúpain due to anxiety‚Äù is given my a doctor who judges you right to your face i have been directly laughed at by multiple doctors told they wont run tests bc i have mental health diagnoses.

1lv7nse,ChronicPain,First day on effective pain management and I'm having a panic attack,"I've had severe, daily, unwavering chronic pain for fifteen years without ever having a medication pain management regimen. Today was my first day starting two new meds and I am currently in the least pain I can ever remember being in. I felt a significantly lower baseline of pain sensation, and amidst this have had hours of the day where I feel how I imagine most people get to feel-not too much pain and occasionally, foreign near-pain-free moments. Comfortable. 

Context paragraph- I'm diagnosed with hypermobile Ehler's Danlos, fibromyalgia, TMJD, a real good host of other physical issues, as well as autism, OCD, CPTSD and a real good host of other mental health issues and neurodivergences. I'm also a recovering alcoholic- huge part of my story- and used cannabis heavily and other psychoactive substances sporadically for a decade. I got sober 10 months ago, weed-free for 8, and currently use no substances and have no active addictions, feels amazing to say. Sobriety has allowed me to lead myself on an intense, harrowing journey to tackle all my health issues I'd been neglecting, worsening and self-medicating for a decade+. I dedicate myself to physical therapy every week, go to the gym for my strength training  5 times a week (key with hEDS and our fucked up connective tissue and collagen), drink my water, prepare all my meals at home and am hyperaware of my diet, do all the things. I spend almost all my day managing my pain with broader approaches. I'm currently in a place where the consequences of my history have disabled me to such a point I haven't worked in nearly a year and am working with a lawyer to get on SSDI. I recently got off SSRIs, which I have been on for the entirety of the 15 years, and feel better than any single point when I was on them. I have somberly realized that I began being overmedicated with antidepressants beginning in childhood as soon as I showed symptoms, when the underlying issues were being unsupported for my neurodivergences, improperly treated for my mental health issues, substance abuse from the jump, trauma, and severe chronic pain and physical disabilities that went untreated. I've been on a real journey here to say the least.

To cut to the chase, I had a big self-advocacy conversation with my doctor where I told her I have suffered long enough, the pain is unacceptable and excruciating. Doing everything you can possibly do and being in 7-10 range pain daily is abnormal, and unacceptable. I've had enough. This isn't the first time by any means that I have had this exact conversation with her (she's been my doctor since I was like 12), but I went harder and further and was more adamant. The result- she prescribed me Meloxicam (NSAID- 15mg) in the morning and told me to take my already prescribed as-needed Cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant- 2.5-5mg) nightly. I had the juiciest sleep last night, and layering on the NSAID with breakfast this morning had me in less pain than I can remember being in without ya know, being wasted.

Feeling relief from the pain has brought on a grief so big I'm currently fending off a panic attack. I can't believe I have suffered so deeply for so long, it is unfathomable. Existing in a body where I am not feeling  overwhelming, constant pain, and understanding this won't be the temporary relief of the Ibuprofen I overuse or the ""put out the fire"" muscle relaxant I occasionally take is mind-bending. When you have the type of unending pain that I (and likely you reading this) experience, it is on the mind our entire waking hours. It's the first thing we register every single morning and the last thing we are fending off in order to sleep (fitfully) every single night. It has been *fifteen fucking years*.

The panic is coming from the grief, rage, disgust, etc., but it's also coming from the completely foreign feeling of its absence. I didn't expect to feel this way. It's frightening, jarring, startling to just exist when the pain demon has been occupying my entire body for fifteen years without break. The only time I have ever not felt pain was when I was entirely whacked out drunk. I'm just here, present and not sedated, feeling this way. Just going about my business without my mind altered, not feeling crippling pain. Because it feels so different, and I am so used to scanning my body to put out fires, my brain got real scared real fast. I'm of course monitoring the effects of these medications and so the first thing I assumed was that they were causing adverse effects- but then I remembered that this is a monumental deal and there is going to need to be space for a mental adjustment, that not every emotion is a symptom and sometimes, there are feelings that just need to be felt and processed.

There's also feelings of holy fuck, relief. Followed by an immediate spiral of do I need to be on this forever? What if the lower doses stop working and I need to up my dose? You bet your entire asshole I'm never going back so am I now dependent on this? What if I get addicted or it stops being enough and I need something harder? There's also some strange twisted thoughts that I'm supposed to feel the pain. If it's there, I'm supposed to feel it and ""covering it up"" is going to result in not knowing the issues I need to tend to and if the veil ever lifts, it's going to be fubar. Unexpected feels.

Can anyone out there relate to this? To the existential and visceral feelings of pain reduction being panic-inducing from its strangeness? Like all of a sudden there's... all this space. A vastness to fill. It feels a bit like stepping off a cliff.

1j4ytnt,ChronicPain,My body is in so much pain that it triggered a panic attack,"
This is new for me. I‚Äôm 30(f) and was diagnosed with fibro in 2016. I also have a neurological condition that causes chronic migraines, an autoimmune condition (MCTD), chronic pelvic pain from a complicated c section healing, and CPTSD. All that to say that I‚Äôm almost always dealing with pain in one way or another. And I do tend to dissociate from my body as a coping mechanism. 

I‚Äôve also experienced a couple of panic attacks in the past related to my PTSD triggers. But I‚Äôve never before experienced a panic attack induced by fibro pain. Is this something others have experienced? 

I knew I was having higher pain/flare ups the past week or so and have been doing my best to care for my body with massages, heating pads, drinking lots of water, warm showers and whatever else my body might need moment to moment. 

Today while working from home I noticed that my words weren‚Äôt wording properly and the brain fog was intense! I let my boss know and then immediately felt emotional about it - I really don‚Äôt like letting people down. I stepped away from my computer to take a break and the emotions led to crying which led to finally admitting to myself how much pain I was actually in. I instinctively began massaging my shoulder which had been bothering me and between tears I said to myself how much my body really hurt. It was like I had been dissociated from my body before that and trying to ignore some of the pain to push through. But saying it out loud sent me back into my body and I felt all the pain. It was intense and it triggered a panic attack.

I was eventually able to calm my breathing and get up from the floor. But now my awareness of my pain is heightened and my body feels awful. I am still emotional and feeling frustrated. Also feeling confused as this is a new experience for me. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Can pain trigger a panic attack? 

Yes I was feeling emotional about my brain fog and lack of productivity at work but I don‚Äôt think that was the true cause of any anxiety. In thinking about it with hindsight I think it was the build up of pain over the past week and the emotions that had to finally go somewhere. Being frustrated about work today seems more like the tipping point, not the root cause. It‚Äôs just weird.

1m36vwn,ChronicPain,First Post: Stress and Flare Ups,"(26, M) First time posting in this sub. I've consulted my doctor before about these flare up, they generally are related to stress for me and are in some ways linked to mental health (I'll explain below). I'm more curious to see if anyone else has experienced this before and if you have any management strategies that work / any suggestions on management or mitigation!

As it is, I have bad knees, I'm overweight and working on it, and I have a diagnosed history of PTSD that would cause muscle tenseness and nerve pain before I was treated (though not anymore, wooo!). As you can imagine, that doesn't make explaining this to doctors and being taken seriously when I try to explain ""this is different"" very fun.

So when I get flare ups it feels like every joint in my body stiffens, nerve pain comes and goes in some areas, that ""on fire"" sensation of inflammation in other areas, and it's progressive. It'll start in spots that make sense (for example: I have bad knees from a few different sports injuries so it may start there for a day first) kinda start to fade, I'll he fine for a day or two just a little sore, then boom it hits the whole body. It's almost like pain similar to an old injury flaring up, combined with the nerve pain I would get when the PTSD was untreated, combined with a ""just did a whole body workout"" kind of soreness.

As it is I try to stick to Tylenol, NSAIDs if I have to, stretching and yoga, ice, heat, rest to recover. I've recently started incorporating strength training and low dose medical marijuana as well and it's really been helping! (Actually the pain itself has gotten better, but a new sensation recently has been this SUPER FUN vibrating or zaping sensation similar to brain zaps).

I work in a pretty high stress job. What I have noticed, as I'm sure many on this sub have experiencef, is that flare ups can be triggered by stress pretty easily. However, rather than it coming up in the middle of a crunch period or like while I'm in the actual thick of it - it is almost always withing 48 hours AFTER a very stressful period has come and gone. It's to the point where just as I'm getting ready to celebrate like a big project coming to an end and should be excited to be able to slow down - I'm spending just as much time bracing myself for the crash.

1hcqae7,ChronicPain,So stressed about the shortages!! ,"These opioid shortages are getting so damned ridiculous. This latest one hit my long acting med, which is hydrocodone ER, the generic of Zohydro ER. I had my med check on the day my new script was due to be filled, so trying to be proactive, I called my pharmacy to make sure they'd have it in stock that day. No problem there. The drama only ensued when the pharmacist called me back and said ""it's on back order, and we won't be able to get any more until January"". I had her check the strengths on either side too, and nope, they were out too. So was every single pharmacy in the surrounding area.

Panic sets in. I have EDS, so I have a lot of issues with the abuse deterrent coating that's used for about 90% of ER pain meds. The ones that dissolve into a glue-like glob when dissolved also do that in my gut, and sit there, and don't allow me to absorb much of the actual medication. I'm also allergic to something in the abuse deterrent in Xtampza, allergic to morphine, and can't metabolize Dilaudid fast enough for it to not reach toxic levels in my body. So my PM suggests methadone, which is a hell no for me because I don't want to go there, and it also wrecked the hell out of my stomach when I had to try it in step therapy. So we finally agreed on 12 mcg fentanyl patches, because the 25mcg ones made me too sleepy, and I'll still have my oxycodone for breakthrough. If it helps we'll enough, we're probably just going to leave it, even though I really like this med I've been on. I was supposed to fill my long acting yesterday, and it just got sent in this morning because of this mess. My doctor was truly apologetic, and is both angry and frustrated  about all of this happening, because he's a CPP himself. I just really hope they get it filled fast, because my oxycodone is nowhere near strong enough to keep me from going into withdrawals.

It's about to get worse too. Even though the DEA and other alphabet agencies had an open comment period before the new quotas were set, I've learned from their other sham open comment periods, like the CDC's for the newest opioid prescribing guidelines in 2022 that had the AMA and other physician's associations, nurse's associations, and so many prominent pain advocacy groups commenting on the harms the last one caused, and how they could make things right, ignored all of these well informed people and did what they wanted.

We have to touch on who instituted these cuts in the first place. In 2017, Trump demanded yearly cuts in production of both opioids and the raw materials. Now Congress is using state PDMP's, most of which are compiled by Bamboo Healthcare and their flawed algorithms, to make determinations as to whether or not cuts need to be made. We aren't ever going to escape this insanity as long as the govt has its claws in our healthcare. 

On another note, the Ohio Supreme Court nullified the $650M opioid law suit against pharmacy chains here (after the lawsuit destroyed one, of course). They determined that product liability laws prohibit counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national chains. All of the money was to go to 2 counties, Lake and Trumbull, not the whole state, to fight an opioid epidemic that hasn't included prescribed opioids in a very long time, and was never US to begin with, but yet we pay daily. Screw those lawyers trying to get multiple billions for themselves that most who were ""actually"" harmed way back then will never see.

I'm honestly a little disappointed at this train of thought. There's a very obvious alternative causal account that they completely gloss over - that the body can sense that something is wrong well before chronic pain manifests, and that this sense of dysphoria/discomfort triggers depression and loneliness. 

This is more in line with my experience, and much more actionable than the vapid idea of an early mental health intervention. If there may be an underlying, sub-clinical physical cause, then perhaps doing a bunch of physical tests can begin to pave the way for a path to recovery.

1gvqm0i,ChronicPain,"Doctor said, ‚ÄòNarcotics make you dumber‚Äô"," 
This happened yesterday and I‚Äôm still incandescent with rage. I was calling in to my mom‚Äôs neurologist appointment (she finally got diagnosed w Alzheimer‚Äôs by this douchebag of a doctor, but he was so busy pressing his own agenda that we were halfway through the appointment before my brother could get the diagnosis out of him).

My mom has a complex medical history that means she‚Äôs spent most of her life in pain, and she‚Äôs 85 now. Dr Douchebag wanted to yank her off her pain meds, antidepressants, and anxiety meds so that he could try his experimental Alzheimer‚Äôs drugs. We‚Äôre not doing that, obviously.

But he flat-out said, ‚ÄòNarcotics make you dumber.‚Äô

I - a person studying nine languages despite being on pain meds, despite brain fog from a TBI, COVID, and menopause - waited a few moments so that I could speak without screaming, and then said, ‚ÄòExcuse me, did you just say ‚ÄúNarcotics make you dumber?‚Äù‚Äô

He said, ‚ÄòYeah. They do.‚Äô

I said, ‚ÄòWell, first of all, that‚Äôs not true, and second of all, that‚Äôs a pretty ableist thing to say.‚Äô

He said, ‚ÄòWell, I don‚Äôt know what that means.‚Äô

I said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs okay, I do.‚Äô

On behalf of all of us: HOW DARE HE? How dare they? 

Edit:  Thank you for all the kind replies, but can we keep in mind that ‚Äòdumb‚Äô is a slur unless we‚Äôre talking about deafness? ‚ÄòIgnorant‚Äô is a great synonym.

1atn431,ChronicPain,Going to a pain doctor was a huge mistake and resulted in my worst fear.,"Here is my experience going to a pain doctor for the first time.  Spoiler alert:  I completely regret going at all, it was my choice to go because I was so hopeful I would get help.

&#x200B;

* Arrogant and uncaring attitude from the first appointment.  I never, not once felt he gave a damn about what I was going through or any had any 	compassion at all.  I am embarrassed and humiliated now of the intimate details I gave him regarding how pain has impacted my life.  
 
* He could tell 	that I didn‚Äôt need to be piss tested, I‚Äôll say that for him, I felt respected in that regard.  
 
* He prescribed trazadone to help me sleep.  
 
* He gave me Trigger Point injections that did not work.  
 
* He prescribed LDN that I took for 9 weeks that did not work at all.  He never told me that the drug blocks the affects of alcohol, this could have resulted in very serious consequences if the pharmacist I spoke to hadn‚Äôt told me about it.  The pharmacist also asked me why I was 	taking the drug.  When I told her for pain, she said ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the doctor prescribing you pain medication then?‚Äù  When I replied ‚Äúlike what?‚Äù  She said ‚Äúlike tramadol, flexiril‚Äù and a few others I can‚Äôt remember.  I eventually mentioned this to my pain doc after all else failed, but more on that later.  
 
* He ordered an MRI of my neck that showed several areas of severe degeneration.  
 
* He then did two medial branch blocks on my neck in hopes I could get a nerve ablation.  When I got the first one, nothing happened until 4 hours later, then I felt so much better.  My mood lifted, I felt like 	myself for the first time in so long, my bubbly personality emerged.  It was amazing.  The 2nd was less effective, but it was less of the lidocaine like substance so that was to be expected.  
 
* After both pain diaries were submitted, he tells me I am not a candidate for the ablation.  He said I should have felt relief in the first 30 minutes and that it should have fallen off after 6 hours.  For me it actually led to some relief for days, though to a lesser degree. I was so hopeful to get it and alleviate some of my pain.  It killed my dreams in an instant.   	  
 
* He had NOTHING else to offer me other than an off label for pain drug called nameda. This drug is used to treat alzheimers primarily.  He did not tell me about any side effects that I later learned are significant.  When I asked him how likely it was to help me, he said not likely at all.  
 
* I asked him about injections like cortisone.  He said that it wouldn‚Äôt help my neck which is where I was having the most acute pain.  Never mind I have back pain and joint pain in my whole body.  He never offered any help for those areas.  I could tell during this call that he was no longer interested in helping me.  
 
* He prescribed me up to 30mg of flexiril a day in 5 mg pills.  My insurance would not cover anything over 3 tablets.  My pharmacist said he should just prescribe 10mg pills at a half pill per dose.  Instead of that he not only didn‚Äôt do that, he kept it at 5 mg and only have me 30 pills for a month‚Äôs supply.  This felt vindictive to me.  
 
* Here is where I was stupid.  Since he had nothing else for me, I told him about my conversation with the pharmacist and tramadol.  He took that as me being ""interested in opioid therapies"" and he put that in my online chart!  My worst fear was now realized; other health care providers could now think I‚Äôm a drug seeker.  I only asked him about 	tramadol after I tried everything he asked me to.  I told him I was worried about all the ibuprofen I was taking.  He said that I should worry more about addiction to opioids than my liver.  I should have known not to ask by how he treated me.  Shows what desperation will do, it affected my judgment.   	  
 

This is a rant obviously.  If you read to the end, thank you sincerely.  I don‚Äôt know where to go from here.  I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and now I have this shitty label on me and I‚Äôm scared.  I asked him to modify the chart note, he actually did and included my message to him that I felt he mischaracterized the conversation, but it still looks bad.

tl/dr Going to a pain management clinic was a huge mistake, I didn‚Äôt get any help and now have the label of drug seeker.  My worst fears were realized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1atn431/going_to_a_pain_doctor_was_a_huge_mistake_and/,1708236072.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

It has been 7 months. It became weak once it has been 6 months but still If there was aggressive light and sounds my head was hurting so I tried GON blocks. But the doc didn't use steroids so every time he did it, it only made my nerves more inflamed and my headaches got worse. Now I was having headaches even If there's no light or sounds, like 24/7. It was being so bad for the first week after blocks, then resolve a little in the second week but after It became second week after the block It would cause rebound effects and my headaches would be the worst of all times, even tho I'm in the dark and there's no sound they would happen. So doc said continue the treatment, they will resolve after the 3rd block but after It, my head started burning. Like my right top side of my head is burning and aching all the time and It was my sore area from the very start but they did GON in the back of my head and said it will spread to the front part too but It never worked. So I tried pregabalin (kinda worked but not entirely), gabapentin (fucked up my stomach), rizatriptan (kinda worked but not entirely again and there's rebound effect so can't use it all the time), paracetamol, dexketoprofen etc. But pregabalin is building up tolerance so fast and I'm starting to worry. I started with 150 mg and now It's 600 in one week. So I want an alternative. I saw phenibut as another gabapentinoid but Its also infamous for high and fast tolerance build. Also I heard that shrooms are very helpful for headaches but I don't have them in my city and I gotta travel if i want them. Tegretol can make my osteoporosis get worse so I dont wanna try. Lamotrigine is infamous for SJS and there's artificial flavors in it and I have interstitial cystitis. 

Long story short I wanna try memanine. Did any of u try it? How's your experiences with it? When will it start working? What's the best dose to start? I'm asking all that here bc in my country it's only known for Alzheimer and I'm gonna use it off label. Doctors don't know shit. Also what's the possible side effects?

1jl8peb,ChronicPain,First post. I need to talk to others who understand...,"Hi all. I'm new here, and so happy to find others who understand. I'm a 44yo female and I've had severe chronic neck and back pain for 16 years. I woke up with it one day, it came literally out of nowhere and I've never had a diagnosis. Drs think it's muscular because nothing shows up on imaging. I've had every type of test and treatment you can imagine - nothing has ever helped for more than a couple hours. Prescription painkillers are the most effective treatment, but I don't take anything regularly. My PCP prescribes me Tylenol 3 for acute instances where my back seizes up, but that's 20 pills every month or two. I'm afraid to ask to refill it more than that because I'm afraid of being seen as a drug-seeker and having it taken away... it's my only refuge.

My life is hard. I quit working paycheck jobs years ago because of the pain, and my inability to feel like a productive dependable employee. I applied for Disability twice and was denied. So I'm a self-employed artist, but barely work and am incredibly poor. I am a single mom to a 6yo high-energy son. I have a new husband who is wonderful, but I know he doesn't understand my pain. He's not always as sympathetic as I'd like. He thinks anyone can just ""push through"" anything. This makes me feel so alone sometimes. 

I also am a partial caretaker for my mom with Alzheimer's. I have a sister who is the main caretaker who lives with her. She is also not sympathetic to my pain and limitations, and probably thinks I just ""need to work a job."" I suspect she resents me for not being the full-time caretaker for my mom AND my son, since I don't have to clock in somewhere each day like she does. 

I read Dr. Sarno's ""Healing Back Pain"" 8 or 9 years ago and have been trying a TMS mode of healing, on and off. It really fits my symptoms, lack of diagnosis, and personality (I'm a total ""Type T"" to the tee!). I've gone deep here, and have read all the books from all the authors and tried all the things. Unfortunately I've had no physical relief with these practices. I'm much more emotionally evolved and self aware, but that's it. 

I GIVE UP. The medical world can't help me and the mind-body TMS world can't help me. I'm so exhausted, sore, sleep-deprived, anxious, depressed, and impoverished all the time. I hate my life and living is exhausting. I love my son and my husband, but that's it. Honestly, I think I may have had a child so I'd be forced to ""stay around."" That probably sounds horrible, but I'm sure some of you can understand. 

Any support, thoughts, suggestions or experiences are welcome. I'm not sure why I wrote this, I just needed to talk to people who understand. xoxo",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1jl8peb/first_post_i_need_to_talk_to_others_who_understand/,1743094635.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1eu0loz,ChronicPain,Possible Dementia DX...I just need to vent a bit.,"Wow. OK....Um‚Ä¶yea‚Ä¶So‚Ä¶<Deep breath>....TL;DR I'm being screened for Dementia. At Wednesday's Doctor appointment I failed the SAGE test. (No short-term memory) We took blood for a liver panel to look for liver/pancreas abnormalities and some other labs associated with Dementia. I went back Yesterday for a liver/kidney ultrasound. I go back in 2 weeks for a SLUMs test and labs review.

¬†So what has been happening‚Ä¶.my short-term memory abruptly went AWOL a month or so ago and has yet to return. I did have the exact same issue Jan to March last year, but that was secondary to the Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseasing (NA-FLD) manifesting. (Hepatic Encephalopathy) That time the cognitive decline was gradual. I am hoping that either my liver is acting up again, fixable, or I am deficient in one Enzyme or another and would just need to take a supplement. I had not considered Dementia and hearing my Doctor say that it was a possibility was like getting hit in the face with a tree. It has my full and undivided attention. (This contributed to the lack of sleep last night that I whined about in an earlier post) After Wednesdays appointment, I realized that I had gotten very frustrated and short with my Doctor as he was asking questions about my cognitive abilities and I was having a difficult time answering his questions, remembering words, remembering what I had just said, etc. He asked how I was doing keeping up with daily activities. (shower, feed myself, do my laundry, etc.) No problems there. HOWEVER, I depend heavily on Alexa and other software to tell me what to do and when. Without these technologies, I would be having a lot of difficulty.

UPDATE: Lab results are in from Wednesday's appointment. Nothing stands out that would explain the loss of short term memory. My liver is behaving. So are the Kidneys. The markers for Alzheimer and Dementia were negative. My labs actually look better than they have in 20 years. My White Count is 10.2. That hasn't been below 11.8 in two decades. (It is normal for people with chronic pain to have a slightly elevated white count) Only a few labs values were out of range and those were mostly off by 1 or 2 points. My Triglycerides have dropped from 343 last Nov., to 163. All of the changes that I made last year are paying off. Now if I can just remember WTF I was doing....",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1eu0loz/possible_dementia_dxi_just_need_to_vent_a_bit/,1723844004.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1k4ek1d,ChronicPain,Counting My Blessings,"I am sure day to day life for everyone in this sub reddit is incredibly difficult‚Ä¶I was just telling a neighbor I befriended that my dog who came to me & I adopted on NYE 2022 (which was a year before I ended up having to quit my job because of my spine deteriorating rapidly & pain) saved my life because if it was not for my promise to him to give him the best life I could, I would have found a way to end my current life. 

I have faced eviction notices, phone & internet was cut off, not being able to afford food so I was living off a cup of apple sauce per day‚Ä¶I caught a break when I reconnected with a family member who had previously cut ties with me due to my disabilities who wanted to help out some financially until I found a job. Unfortunately he has developed Alzheimer‚Äôs, and in one of his fits he cut me off because I was doing exactly as he requested but did not remember me doing so. That‚Äôs a whole other thing.

Before my financial issues I was very passionate about helping those less fortunate specifically the homeless community by making bags me & my friends could pass out to pan handlers. They were basic necessities every person needs, items homeless shelters tell me people need most + snacks & water‚Ä¶it meant so much to those strangers I encountered for a few seconds when handing those bags off.

I share this because whenever I am feeling down or my bank account goes negative, I am not sure where I will find money to survive next, my pain is out of control, I am lonely because I cannot really leave my home for physical & financial reasons‚Ä¶I remind myself that I have a roof over my head, a cozy bed to sleep in, a shower, something to eat, the love for & from my furry companions, the ability to cook (even if I have to spend an entire day cooking when it would take the average person maybe 2 hours), and pain medication that allows me to function as much as my body allows, I can still walk despite most people in my condition not being able to.

Those strangers do not have most of that and some of them who are disabled have none of it‚Ä¶

The first link is something I posted about 2 years ago.  The second is to a comment I made about 6 months ago.  Something I believed with my whole heart.  Cancer is finite.  It has an end point.  Its testable; they see it.  No one argues; because it's cancer.  I've made many comments over the years how that's more forgiving than my ankylosing spondylitis or epidural lipomatosis slowly claiming my legs. 

I made it; 2 years.  When I wrote the first post; I started having severe hand pain; while it hasn't gotten much better; the hand pain has numbed.  Everything else though have continued to worsen.  I said I was at a 10, 2 years ago; I was wrong.  I don't have to tell y'all the pain scale is stupid.  You can do it 2 ways ""well it isn't as bad as a broken femur"" and say your pain is less than it is; or they tell you to do it ""10 as the worst pain you've ever felt"" I've- never broken my femur.  I've never had a child.  That's- stupid.  Maybe my lack of understanding the pain scale is the autism; but I'm pretty sure it's just dumb.

This last year has been rough.  I lost my support system, my grandpa's house.  I am now having to pay an astronomical amount of rent that I can't afford because I can't work much; and in my red state? forget about trying for disability.  I complained last time about not being able to afford college that my disability is going to take away my job; and then I wrote that bit about cancer; several times; typically thoughts like that I keep away from places like reddit.  

I call myself a disability advocate; I say I stand up for people like us; and I speak up for the autistic community (which I am apart of) I always say disabilities don't make us less than.  But here these past weeks; I do feel less than.  I believe that people with disabilities have the right to see their disability the way they see it; that we shouldn't look for the glass half full.  ""well all disabilities have upsides"" is toxic.  But if I saw a post like mine; I'd tell them they aren't less than.  But I cannot believe that for myself.  There are no more positives.  I just slowly lose the things in my life keeping me going.  

I've been having issues with my blood sugars.  Lows in the 50s; I'll drink some OJ.  Not that it always helps.  I went to the doc; we got some blood work; my insulin was up to 30.2.  He wants me to get a CGM see what my sugars are doing.  My grandma had pancreas cancer.  No.  I always made jokes I have 2 lines in the sand; ""doing math every time I eat"" and ""not being able to eat bread"" I knew both are a possibility.  I am likely to have chon's or get celiac eventually; autoimmune disorders are like potato chips and my mom; has so many potato chips.  

2 years ago I said I was done with doctors; I was over it.  I am on so many meds I am sleepy, dopey, tired.  They don't even get rid of most of the pain.  I just started a biologic and now my muscles are so hard its tough to move but I was told to try a couple cycles.  Why when we see a med doing something awful; I have to grit my teeth and hope it stops?  (I'm looking at you dopamax) 

I don't want to get a CGM.  I don't want to know if its a pancreas tumor making too much insulin; I could just be resistant; sure.  

For years I've said I was done.  I said cancer would be better than suffering being told I am ""too young"" and not getting the right answers.  I've spent the past decade looking for answers; and now I don't want them? 

I said I was done; and now I am sobbing and scared and I don't want this.  I said in my last post my grandpa killed himself; it was very my grandpa.  He knew he had Alzheimer's like his mom; and he refused that answer; he took it into his own hands and he went out the same way he lived his life; on his terms. 

I don't want to live in pain anymore; but now I don't want this either.  I don't want to die.  I have spent the past several months respecting my grandpa; because I don't want to die; there's still a chance a small flicker; maybe I can go to college; maybe I still have a chance (maybe not getting into politics but holy shit; no; that's getting less and less of a chance)

My grandpa died at 74.  He died old.  He lost his person; it was over for him; he didn't want me to visit one day to no more him.  I am 24 next month.  I don't want this.  

I don't know what I want from this post; support or someone to read this and maybe get it?  What I need to do is go pick up that CGM.  I know what I need to do; but I don't want answers anymore; there isn't a situation where we find an answer to this that I think I can handle.  

I have dealt with numbness in my legs; losing feeling for up to 30 minutes in the mornings; falls; seizures; migraines; arthritis; pain worse than when I broke my wrist in 3 places; losing my grandpa; my support system; his house; concussions; post concussion syndrome; navigating doctors as an AFAB induvial; as someone with autism; as someone with depression and anxiety on my chart. 

I don't know if I can handle these next steps.  My chronic pain, my disabilities are slowly taking everything from me; I don't want more.

Then 18 months ago, my insurance company decided that even though we had 18 months of documented, proven success that they had previously authorized and covered.... That the treatment was experimental and stripped it away.

No step downs. Cold turkey. 


I'm back in a wheelchair. I need multiple surgeries but the doctors wont proceed without the Ketamine on board due to the level of horrific pain it will put me into and the almost guaranteed spread of the CRPS. 

I feel so forgotten. So hated. 

And I have been telling my doctor that my brain hurts. Not like a migraine. Not like a headache but this extreme vibration/pulsing that I cannot get rid of. 

I also cannot focus. I've never dealt with these issues before. I can't comprehend things I used to. I can't select proper words. (For example. Telling my husband the dogs lead line should be attached to her leash (instead of collar)

1cl8lkj,ChronicPain,Dementia and pain,"I'm relatively young but I have several relatives who have a type of dementia that is likely genetic. I'm not considering testing right now- I would rather not know. I have 20+ years before the symptoms would start, so my plan is to live my life for at least ten years and then revisit whether testing makes sense for me. 

I found out that my dad somehow managed to dislocate his shoulder and wasn't able to express the pain so nobody noticed until he had a medical check (he's mostly bedridden so nobody noticed the reduced range of motion). 

And I have a new fear now. I'm terrified of getting the dementia and my pain not being controlled, but me not being able to tell anyone. I know hospice will push morphine, etc, but there can be a big gap between dementia starting and hospice (my dad couldn't express himself for almost three years prior to qualifying for hospice).

I recently quit marijuana because it was giving me high suicide ideation, like planning and setting a date and everything. For some reason sativa and hybrid opens the flood gates of pain signals to my brain, where as no marijuana brain can block out more of the thoughts.

They give me 10/325 for the pain but I hate taking it to try to sleep because I prefer to be pain free when interacting with family and friends...not sleeping.

1jlcm3p,ChronicPain,My psychiatrist asked me if I would consider trying medical cannabis,"Hi y'all, I'm the guy who made the post about lyrica and gabapentin, and the fact that since it's very likely Im getting dementia these kind of medications increase the risk

Today I visited my psychiatrist and..
I told her this, she agreed, I also told her about pain management clinics, she told me I could try but to not expect anything shocking, they would probably try cymbalta (which is what I'm getting now), amitriptyline etc, perhaps also recommend pt like other docs, she just told me that it's not that different from going let's say to a neurologist, but could perhaps show me alternative treatments and guide me. And of course lastly opioids, which is something pain management can do, but I told her, openly, that at least in my current psychological state, I'm not sure if i want to have opioids in my hands, I'm not against opioids, I'm just not comfortable with myself.

She understood, she then asked me if I would try medical thc, perhaps a topical even. 

Obviously I was a bit surprised. I know THC can be very valuable, but as far as I know, in the psychiatric field psychiatrists don't like Marijuana, I constantly hear about it causing psychosis, messing up the brain etc, and all these things I'm hearing from actual doctors not your random joe, but I was surprised that she mentioned it.

Medical thc is widely available in my country, and you can get a prescription just by chatting with a doctor online, yes, it's that easy, it's still very controversial and looked down upon but we've implemented it fully.



Do you think this is a good idea? I really wonder what drug messes up your brain the least. I suppose snris ain't great either but probably not as bad a gabapenoids, so then it comes down to cannabis vs opioids, I suppose if I end up getting addicted to opioids it's far worse than cannabis, but let's say everything goes as planned and I listen to the docs and don't disobey them, what do you think? Which one is worse long term?

17vuyao,ChronicPain,Non-opiod meds to be careful with,"Hi all! Two of us were having a mini convo about this on another thread and I thought it might be good to post something.  Let‚Äôs talk about meds to be cautious of that are non-opiods. There are many Drs seem to be prescribing us chronic pain patients and are not warning anyone. Unless of course it‚Äôs an opiod and then you get a big lecture. I‚Äôll start here with some of mine below but would love others to add for everyone‚Äôs benefit. I think it would be really useful.  I‚Äôm no Dr but have done lots of homework on ones I‚Äôve been prescribed as I encourage everyone to do. I‚Äôm not saying anyone should not take these as they may be appropriate, just raising awareness and talk to your Dr

1. Gabapentin- Drs handing out like candy for any type of pain it seems, especially trying to replace narcotics.  From what I hear it‚Äôs supposed to be best for nerve pain. Personally I couldn‚Äôt get past 600mg due to side effects. Doses usually in the 1200-2100mg from what I‚Äôve seen. These can be extremely hard to get off of and require a really really slow taper.  I‚Äôve heard many say the withdrawal is worse than opiods.  Side note, I have been taking 300mg every night before bed because it helps keep me asleep and has been very useful for my insomnia 
2. Valium- ok, maybe obvious because it‚Äôs in the bentos category. I take this everyday for my condition (cervical dystonia). My Rx is 3x a day but I only take at night because I don‚Äôt want to get too dependent.  Worst days I might take another during the day. I‚Äôve taken 2 day breaks here and there to ‚Äúcheck myself‚Äù and haven‚Äôt experienced withdrawal but I‚Äôve only been on 7 months. Prescribed for muscle spasms
3. Baclofen- this was also prescribed for muscle spasms. I took one and couldn‚Äôt stand the side effects. While it can be very useful, this is another that is very hard to get off of with bad withdrawals even at lower doses and couple months use. There‚Äôs an entire sub on this and many are struggling with dependence
4. Artane (trihexyphenidyl). This one is much more rare but I was prescribed for cervical dystonia.  It‚Äôs an anticholenergic case is Benadryl (but much stronger).  Also used for Parkinson‚Äôs and people with tremors due to some anti depressants (tardive dyskinesia).  Same thing, some people will abuse (no idea why you‚Äôd want to but people do) and not only can there be major withdrawal but it can be very dangerous withdrawal.

Please feel free to add. Again, I am not a Dr and these I noted can be very helpful for people but Drs didn‚Äôt warn me at all. 

Hope this is helpful!  Wishing everyone peace today üòäüôè",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/17vuyao/nonopiod_meds_to_be_careful_with/,1700058927.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1t2eas,ChronicPain,I don't know how to cope with my memory loss.,"I hit my head pretty hard on the pavement in my accident. I had a helmet on, but it caused severe soft tissue damage in my neck. 

One of the symptoms of this is apparently memory loss. I'm a psych student (graduating tomorrow actually!), so I understand the memory system. I am having trouble forming some new memories, and having trouble retrieving some memories from long ago. 

I might forget a short conversation, forget I've read an email or text, forget doing something (or not doing it), walk into a room and have no idea why, go to the store for something then forget what it was and leave without it, forget where I parked the car, if I've fed to the dog, to pay my bills. 

Memories from a long time ago (more than six months), I can usually recall if prompted. I'd say 80% I can eventually remember if given a few details. 

So far I can't find any real pattern between what I'm forgetting. I'm not taking heavy pain killers very often, trying not to, because they make it worse. 

I'm just not sure how to deal with it, or what to do. I've started doing brain exercises, but I lost a game of memory to a 3 year old the other day. I think I'm getting worse.

I do have a doctor who I will see about this. I told my check up doctor about it at the hospital, and about ringing in my ears, and he wasn't bothered by it. I'm of the opinion it will go away once my injury heals.

1m2j7kj,AskDocs,"21F ‚Äì Elevated Calprotectin (367), Ongoing Abdominal Pain ‚Äì Extremely Anxious About IBD","Hi, I‚Äôm a 21-year-old female and recently got some concerning test results related to ongoing abdominal symptoms. I‚Äôm feeling really anxious and scared that I might have IBD (like Crohn‚Äôs or ulcerative colitis), and that things might suddenly get worse before I get treatment. I would really appreciate any input or shared experiences.

I currently take Effexor (venlafaxine) And Concerta (methylphenidate) but haven‚Äôt taken my concerta since mid-June. I‚Äôm also using Movicol right now because I‚Äôm constipated.

‚∏ª I‚Äôve had abdominal problems since I was a kid and have been in and out of the ER multiple times over the years for suspected appendicitis, but it‚Äôs never been confirmed. In the past, I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs most likely IBS or anxiety-related.

I sometimes get extremely painful stomach cramps that usually improve after a bowel movement

I‚Äôve never had blood in my stool, but I do have alternating diarrhea and constipation, especially during periods of anxiety or stress. Sometimes I have mucus as well.

These symptoms have been coming and going for years

In May, I developed persistent pain in my lower right abdomen with diarrhea that lasted about two weeks. I went to the ER during that time because I was very sure it was appendicitis, but blood (CRP) and urine tests came back normal. They told me it was probably stress-related.

About three weeks later, the pain returned again. I had diarrhea for a few days, then became constipated, and the pain has been ongoing since. It sometimes radiates to my back. I currently don‚Äôt have diarrhea, but the pain is still there. It is not extremely painful, it‚Äôs more like a dull ache. I have not had any fever that I know about, and no weight loss.

These persistent symptoms led me to do a check-up with my doctor. We ran blood, urine, and stool tests last Friday, and I just got the stool results today which has made my anxiety much worse.


My Test Results: 
Calprotectin: 367.
CRP (blood): Normal.
Urine tests: Normal.
 Blood tests: ferritin 12, (but it has been like that since 2021) otherwise normal. 
Stool tests: Colitis and Helicobacter pylori have been ruled out.

My doctor gave me two options:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Wait 6 weeks and repeat the calprotectin to see if the inflammation goes down
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Or get a referral for a specialist and possibly a colonoscopy (though she mentioned it could take weeks to get an appointment). She is going to call me tomorrow to ask what my decision is.

So here are my questions,

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Is an elevated calprotectin of 367 enough to justify a colonoscopy now?
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Should I wait 6 weeks or push for more testing?
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Is there a risk that if I do have IBD, it could suddenly worsen before I get proper treatment?

I know it might sound dramatic, but I‚Äôm so scared. I‚Äôve been crying all day since I got the results, and I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôm going to die if this gets worse before getting the right treatment. I feel like I have gotten a death sentence basically ü•≤. ( I have severe health anxiety and GAD).

1lxh6zl,AskDocs,Help IBD? Flare up?,"Hi, I‚Äôm female and 23 years old. Since I was 14, I‚Äôve repeatedly had severe gastrointestinal issues, including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. I was often in the hospital as a child and even back then always had elevated inflammation markers, but they kept saying it was just ‚Äúirritable bowel syndrome (IBS).‚Äù

However, my symptoms have worsened over the past few months and no longer go away. I constantly have mucus in my stool, which is yellow/orange/brown in color and very thick and sticky‚Äîsometimes there‚Äôs blood. My stool is very bulky, mushy/loose in consistency, and contains undigested food. I have pain around my navel and increasingly on the left side. I often have sudden fevers around 38.5¬∞C and am almost always subfebrile. The color of my stool is often yellow/green.

Some of my blood values are also abnormal:
- Hemoglobin: 7.4 (borderline low)
- White blood cells: 13 (elevated)
- Lymphocytes %: 17 (low)
- Potassium: 3.7 (low)
- CRP: always between 6‚Äì30, never below 6 (elevated)
- Albumin: 50 (low)
- Alpha-1-globulin: 7 (elevated)
- Alpha-2-globulin: 14 (elevated)
- Neutrophils: 9 (elevated)

I‚Äôve already had a gastroscopy, which showed mild inflammation. My colonoscopy is scheduled for next week. Could this be IBD even though my calprotectin level is normal but my blood clearly shows signs of inflammation? IBS doesn‚Äôt usually cause blood changes like this or fever. Maybe someone can help me.

What were your blood values/calprotectin levels at the time of diagnosis? And what were your symptoms? Is it possible to have IBD even if calprotectin is low but blood markers show significant inflammation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lxh6zl/help_ibd_flare_up/,1752265003.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
1lmadru,AskDocs,Might have IBD,"I'm a 24M with some GI issues. Looking back my first symptoms probably started about a year ago but you know how it is, you don't pay attention to subtle things at the time. It started with having days or nights with pretty severe stomach cramps that would make it difficult to sleep and diarrhea. But this would resolve within 24-48 hours. No fever, no particular pattern with the type of food. Just random. This happened a few times over several months. 

Then I'd say during the last 4 ish months I've noticed fatigue thats slowly worsened, stomach pain, nausea, feeling full really quickly and some blood in my stool. Also instead of going to toilet 1-2 times a day, I'd be going 4-5 times. And when I say fatigue btw I mean as in collapse in bed, don't want to move, literally 0 energy. But then other days I'd feel pretty ok. Stomach pain ranges from just an irritating uncomfortable feeling to more of a cramp across my lower abdo. When it does localise it's either lower right (most frequent), belly button area and sometimes lower right. And that feels like a sharp pressing pain across the effected area. Blood in stool has been tiny darkish streaks. And sometimes bright red blood when I wipe which comes with rectal aching for a day or so. Blood has been there maybe once a month max. 

Fast forward to last month, I went to A&E for what I thought was appendicitis. Had a couple of days feeling really ill, intermediate global abdo pain, watery diarrhea, nausea, no appetite. Pain just kept getting worse and eventually migrated to lower right quadrant...so very reluctantly, off to A&E I went. Bloods showed normal inflammatory markers and the ultrasound and CT showed my appendix was fine. Whoohoo happy days, got sent home. However, my CT did show wall thickening of the sigmoid colon. The cause was put down as diverticulitis with no follow up or further treatment needed. They didn't tell me this, I just read it on my discharge papers. I thought that was a bit strange because I don't have any of the risk factors for diverticulosis and I was under the impression you need a bit more investigation to have that as a definite diagnosis. 

I was feel generally ok after being discharged. But the fatigue kept getting worse to the point where Id spend all day in bed. Jesus I felt ill. And occasional cramping stomach pain making it hard to sleep. I also had a mouth sore that spread to my lip whilst i was dealing with this 'flare up' if i can call it that. And I noticed more bright red blood when wiping and rectal pain. So I booked a follow up appointment with my GP. Did a FITT which came back pos for blood. I've been referred to the GI team at the hospital, I've got an initial phone call appointment with them next week, I'm really hoping they book me in for a colonoscopy to have a look at what's going on. And got more blood tests booked looking for anaemia and deficiencies etc. I've also got to do a fecal calprotein test so I'm being well looked after. 

Between being in hospital and now, the fatigue has got alot worse. Beforehand I put it down to stress and just being busy all the time because I'd still have moments of feeling alright. But over the last couple of weeks I'm having to have lying down breaks during the day and my eyes close whilst I'm just sat up not doing anything. I don't have any energy put simply. Ill be in the middle of brushing my teeth and just need a min of standing completely still with my eyes closed. I've genuinely never experienced anything like it. Stomach pain that happened occasionally is now happening almost everyday. Not really painful just irritating and uncomfortable. Bowel movements have been solid but I've noticed mucus build up. More bright red blood and rectal pain happened once at the beginning of this week. Nausea is also getting worse, it's at a low level just constant. I have 0 appetite. I feel ill if I eat and ill if I don't. I'll take one bite of food and my body just doesn't want anymore. I've ended up losing about 3kg this month which I know isn't alot but I'm not trying to lose weight. 

Other than asthma, I'm otherwise fit and healthy. No allergies, not diabetic. No hx of colon cancer on either sides of my family. I run, I eat well. The GP thinks it might be IBD. I'm not having diarrhea or blood all the time infact I'm kinda constipated but that's probably down to me not eating much over the last few days. And the pain isn't severe but I guess my case could be mild? I know I've not been diagnosed with anything yet but would I be right to assume IBD is likely? 

Also I'm a student paramedic about to qualify so I've been trying to finish assignments and get ready for placement whilst this has been going on. I'm been thinking of differential diagnosis and being a stereotypically bad patient who initially ignored and down played his symptoms but I'm now at a point where even I can't ignore them. I'm exhausted and in pain everyday and even I know that's not normal.

1lq5xjw,AskDocs,doctors suspect I have IBD but can't diagnose me,"Hello, 
I am 18 years old, female, I am 174 cm tall and weigh 63 kg, I have had stomach pain and diarrhea for a year (but I am not losing weight), it started when I took 9 different antibiotics for frequent tonsillitis (every month) in six months. 
I took the last antibiotics for tonsillitis, pneumonia and appendicitis, after that, my abdominal pain and diarrhea started, but it was not too frequent or bad, Imodium could helped me. 
About six months later I had appendicitis again, before that I had antibiotics twice for tonsillitis. When I had appendicitis for the second time, I had to have surgery, the inflammation was not too big, but the doctors found mesenteric lymphadenitis - inflammation of the lymph nodes, they told me to go to the gastroenterology department with it. 
After the appendectomy, my diarrhea and abdominal pain got much worse, and they persist for more than half a year. I have pain mainly in the right side of my abdomen, where I still have mesenteric lymphadenitis, but in a mild form according to the ultrasound, I also have pain around my belly button, I have stabbing pains in the lower right side of my abdomen after a bowel movement, I am also very tired, I never feel rested. 
Every morning I have abdominal pain and diarrhea, my abdomen hurts the most in the morning and after eating, when I also always have diarrhea or mushy stools within 10-15 minutes. I am not sure if I have blood in my stool, but I am bleeding from the rectum. I have also had higher temperatures lately and my joints hurt, and I have also noticed more frequent tingling in my limbs.
The doctors did a gastroscopy, a colonoscopy - they found nothing, they also took blood and stool - my CRP was around 9, my calprotectin was 1 188 and the doctor thought I had ulcerative colitis, but the second time it came out negative and nothing was seen on the colonoscopy. 
The doctor gave me pills for irritable bowel syndrome, which I had already taken once and did not help - duspatalin retard, then antibiotics - entizol and normix, antidepressants - cipralex, probiotics - mutaflor, and supplements magnosolv and vigantol - vitamin D.
Otherwise I take zodac for seasonal allergies and contraception (leverette) and iron (maltofer) - but my anemia has improved in the last few years, 3 years ago my values ‚Äã‚Äãwere around 80, now my values ‚Äã‚Äãare 116 and I stopped taking iron recently because my doctor told me it can cause diarrhea.
I've been taking the pills for a week and I haven't noticed any improvement, rather worse diarrhea and even a slightly elevated temperature of around 37.2¬∞C and I've been dizzy a lot and recently I've started to feel worse after stools, I used to have a dull pain, now I'm waiting to go to the hospital for a CT scan, but the doctor doesn't know what to do and said that there is inflammation due to mesenteric lymphadenitis around the intestines, but there's nothing on the colonoscopy, so she'll consult with colleagues.

1kkgsyo,AskDocs,Need advice or at least read similar stories to lower anxiety - Ongoing foot inflammation (Gout? IBD arthritis? Something else ?),"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a 35-year-old guy with Crohn‚Äôs disease (diagnosed 12 years ago, had a 60 cm bowel resection). I take daily cholestyramine, but no other meds long-term. No family history of Crohn‚Äôs, arthritis, or gout.

For the past couple of years, my crohn has been calm and without symptoms, but I‚Äôve been getting lately weird, painful flare-ups in my feet ‚Äî mostly the right foot at first, but now also the left. It‚Äôs been hard to figure out what‚Äôs really going on, so I‚Äôm hoping someone here might relate.

Here‚Äôs a quick summary:

Summer 2022: First big flare ‚Äî my whole right foot swelled up, especially the big toe area. It happened after a long day of sports and likely dehydration. Thought it might be gout, because pain appeared suddenly and intensively at night. 

Late summer 2024: Hurt my right Achilles during sports. Next day I couldn‚Äôt walk. Was diagnosed with microtears. Later, stretching exercises triggered inflammation under the big toe (felt more mechanical than gouty).

Fall 2024 ‚Äì Early 2025: A few more flares in the same spot (right foot, under the big toe). Pain comes on gradually over 1‚Äì2 days, not suddenly. Naproxen helped, but messed up my stomach, and my calprotectin came back high, so I switched meds (by the way, all my other blood work seems fine).

Late April 2025: Another flare started in the right foot, then moved to the left foot, this time at the back of the heel/Achilles insertion. No injury, no sport, no trigger. Just pain and stiffness that made it hard to walk.

I‚Äôve had one slightly high uric acid result, but others were normal. A podiatrist thought it was gout. My GI nurse said Crohn's and gout aren't really connected. Now I‚Äôm wondering if it could be IBD-related arthritis. Still haven‚Äôt seen a rheumatologist yet, but in the process of‚Ä¶

I'm now trying celecoxib, which helps and seems easier on the gut than naproxen. But I‚Äôm kind of at a loss. These flares hit hard, and they‚Äôre messing with my quality of life ‚Äî I‚Äôve even had to stop practicing sport (ball hockey on foot), can be hard on joints, but which I love. Sometimes the flares happen a day or two after playing‚Ä¶ It could be related..

Main symptoms:

Foot pain that builds up gradually (not sudden)

Pain mostly under the big toe (sesamoid) or at the back of the heel (enthesopathy)

Sometimes mild swelling/stiffness, no obvious redness

Naproxen helps, but messes with digestion

No other joints affected, no back pain

If anyone has dealt with something like this ‚Äî especially Crohn‚Äôs folks or people with gout/arthritis ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from you. Just trying to make sense of it all and push for the right kind of care.

We‚Äôve seen 3 specialists in the past, and today a 4th has more or less said they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôm at a loss and she‚Äôs pretty much given up all hope. I‚Äôm willing to try anything at this point. 

Patient Age: 20
Weight: 210
Height: 5‚Äô8‚Äù
Blood Type: A-
Lives in South East USA

Previously Existing Conditions:
- PCOS (being treated with high estrogen birth control)
-Gallbladder Failure (removed at 16% utilization around 3 months ago)

Symptoms:
- Blood in Stool (around 25%-50% of the movement is blood. Bright red in color.)
- Diarrhea (3-12 times per day)
- Fatigue (She still works a 40 hour work week in a food joint)
- Pain in upper left abdomen and lower left abdomen (for the most part isolated to these areas)
- Severe Nausea (will throw up around 3-4 times a week, almost always after eating)
- Ulcers in her left colon (2 colonoscopies have shown these. Around 12 ulcers in total.)
- Hernia in her throat (found during an endoscopy about 6 months ago) 
- Stomach and Colon are both inflamed

Now for the real kicker. 

- All stool samples( 3 spaced out around a year each)

- All blood work (god knows how many vials they‚Äôve taken)

- All explorative operations (previously listed)

All show no markers for absolutely anything. No cancer, no IBD related ailments, no UC, no Chrohn‚Äôs, No Celiac, no IBS, no Parasites(that they‚Äôve tested for), no bleeding disorders, nothing. 

Everything says she‚Äôs healthy as can be. All anti-diarrheal drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs have been ineffective. She‚Äôs steadily losing weight(we believe to be because of the lack of gallbladder), steadily losing blood (despite this she is not anemic), and we are steadily losing hope.

I‚Äôm in the process of setting up appointments with an oncologist, a hematologist, and a food allergy specialist, because I‚Äôll try anything at this point. 

I know it‚Äôs a long shot but any ideas or paths we might should go down will be appreciated. 

I will also answer any questions about anything, I‚Äôve got years of information to give out. 


Update 1: Since a lot have been asking, here are all the documents she currently possesses. This is not all of them by any means, but it‚Äôs all the ones she can find right now. https://imgur.com/a/IhUrNyH

Update 2: Wanted to answer/clarify a few things. First, my wife is having up to 12 bowel movements a day, 50% of them don‚Äôt contain blood. At least one a day does, which contains up to 50% blood. Second, I don‚Äôt necessarily believe it‚Äôs an exaggeration that she‚Äôs dying. 4 specialists have been dumbfounded and she‚Äôs miserable. If whatever condition doesn‚Äôt kill her, the stress and depression will. Thirdly, to anyone who has provided legitimate advice or shared your story or even DM‚Äôd me, my wife has read all of them and appreciates them all more than you could know, it‚Äôs been a shit show(pun not intended) for almost 4 years. This eats away at you in insane ways. Especially when you‚Äôre only 20 and a fifth of your life has been slave to a toilet. But to everyone, thank you, from both of us.

1k35vdq,AskDocs,Could this be IBD? Radiology reports included...,"Background - \[22F\], 168cm, 61.7kg, white British, abdominal pain and bowel changes.

  
PMH - 16 months of ME/CFS (recently formally diagnosed). Ferritin of 5 12 months ago, iron infusion to treat this. Sertraline and COCP.

  
3 weeks of abdominal pain. Initially felt odd discomfort within my right lower abdomen, then palpation of abdomen elicited tenderness. Referred to hospital by GP to rule out appendicitis. Then developed changes in bowel habit (urgency, opening bowels more frequently, tenesmus, periodic diarrhoea and loose stools, increased mucus in stools). No fevers, vomiting, etc. 5 days in and out of hospital for tests (kill me lol, this is why I didn't want to go to the hospital over the weekend) - summary of tests attached. Symptoms improved and I was discharged with a follow up colonoscopy and pending faecal calprotectin results. The hospital stay was shambles so I just wanted some advice

  
Since then, I've had abdominal pain again and the same bowel changes  - general discomfort,  tenderness when pressed, some decrease in appetite, a small amount of weight loss (only 1.5kg), some random stabbing pains (mostly in the RIF but also some in the RUQ and around my belly button). I'm really fatigued (but that's pretty common for me). 

  
My main question is regarding the test results. As far as I can tell, the transabdominal ultrasound suggested bowel thickening, the CT scan was somewhat inconclusive due to uterus positioning and suggested the possibility of PID, the transvaginal ultrasound pretty much ruled out PID. So...



\- Can PID seem similar to IBD on CT scans?

  
\- Does the ""no convincing mural thickening"" mean that it's hard to interpret and this is still not ruled out?

  
\- Could the low ferritin have been due to IBD all this time? And therefore contributing to the fatigue?

  
\- Is there anything else this could be?

  
*CRP: 25; WCC: 9.80; Neutrophils: 5.76.*

*U&Es and LFTs are satisfactory.*

*US abdomen and pelvis on 05/04/25: At the site of maximum patient pain, within the right iliac fossa, there is a region of thick-walled, echogenic bowel. Whilst there does appear to be a blind-ending section of bowel within this, which likely represents a distended appendix, it is not the only area of inflamed bowel and other inflammatory bowel pathology cannot be excluded. The surrounding fat appears echogenic and there is a trace of free fluid within the right iliac fossa. Several bulky mesenteric lymph nodes are noted, measuring up to 11 mm in AP diameter.*

*CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast on 05/04/25:*

*The uterus is retroverted and deviated to the right with fundus abutting the right pelvic sidewall. It is abutting multiple loops of ileal small bowel, which are nondistended.*

*Consequently assessment of the bowel is slightly hindered by crowding of viscera and paucity of abdominal fat. No convincing mural thickening demonstrated on CT. No adnexal mass or hydrosalpinx demonstrated. A trace of fluid within the pelvis is within normal physiological limits. No enhancing collection. Normal appearance of the appendix. No inflammatory fat stranding identified within the right lower quadrant.*

*US pelvis transvaginal on 08/04/25:*

*The uterus is retroverted and normal in size, shape and echotexture. The endometrium measures 3 mm, which is within normal limits for a pre-menopausal patient. The maximum length of the endometrial cavity measures 57 mm. Both ovaries appear normal. No free fluid or obvious adnexal pathology*

1jswesy,AskDocs,"Could it be bowel endo, IBD, SIBO etc?","28 F. History of GERD, ASD.

Since February, I‚Äôve been getting green mucus in my stool on and off but more and more frequently‚Ä¶.as well as frequent, infrequent bowel movements and intense cramping in the lower abdomen and low rib area (even back at times)‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs near my period and yet again expecting intense cramping and again put a little more frequently than usual and having a bit of green poop and mucus‚Ä¶.no diarrhoea (although when I flare up, diarrhoea can occasionally occur..)

I just had a CT scan to check for cancer, IBD etc and it came back as all clear. Obviously as I already knew that CT doesn‚Äôt really pick up anything anyways‚Ä¶..They said that there were benign cysts on my liver but nothing to worry about and that‚Äôs that‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm still on an investigation to see if there is endo, as I might book private. I‚Äôbe also been referred to gastroenterology and I‚Äôm yet to have an appointment. Although I‚Äôm not keen on colonoscopy due to health C-PTSD and low weight/BMI, and the prep which could pose a risk‚Ä¶etc. Tbh I also document my patterns to me knowledge found out that I also had green mucus this time last year although it wasn‚Äôt common and it didn‚Äôt happen again since then up until this point this year.

I had an appointment with my GP after I did a (FIT) a Faecal Immunochemical Test where they found, 17 ug/g. Which is out of range meaning that there was a bit of blood. Just a very small amount.  (Not seen by the eye). My calprotectin was 80 in Sept 2024 (average is 50 and lower) and I did a follow up and now it‚Äôs gone up to 97. (Feb 2025)

 After dealing with constant flare up and cramping for 4/5 years that have lead to being in and out of A&E‚Ä¶..I was diagnosed with adenomyosis in Sept/Oct 2024. I cannot help but feel that it been slightly raised and all of this is due to a possible presence of endo, especially in the bowel area‚Ä¶.but my GP keeps dismissing thinking that endo cannot show up on such tests. I beg to defer. I‚Äôm aware they want to rule out IBD‚Ä¶but due to the nature of the symptoms I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs endo and it can‚Äôt help but feel like that it keeps getting brushed over, even subtly. :/ 

When I‚Äôm in luteal phase/ovulation or if it‚Äôs a lead up to my period, during and after it can get worse get cramping and gassy like heck. Cramps get worse either during lead up to period, during or after during ovulation/luteal phase which in my opinion is the most painful time of the month for me.

1k051eb,AskDocs,Is there a test to completely rule out or confirm IBD? Or is it just a game of chance to find evidence of symptoms.,"I (26,F) believe I might have a IBD, but I have mixed answers from specialists with 2 being inconclusive and 2 saying I dont, those last ones being Gastroenterologist's...

I have had gastrointestinal problems since I was young, always struggling with bowel movements in one way or another and severe abdominal pain, but it became notable about 2 years ago when I also developed rectal bleeding that 3 doctors, a gastro surgeon, my GP, and a hematologist all said wasn't linked to hemmeroids, which I have, and severe lower abdominal pain, usually located on the sides and reaching towards the belly button.

We've done every test in the book to find the cause of the bleeding and pain as I began to develop iron deficiency anemia, needing iron transfusions every 6 months. All of the following tests were performed by a forth doctor, my ""regular"" Gastroenterologist who I've seen less times than the other 3 doctors. I've had 3 colonoscopies each with biopsy, 2 upper scopes, 1 capsule study to look into the small intestine, 3 abdominal CT's, 2 MRI's, and many many counts of bloodwork. The only notable things ever found on the blood work were low hemoglobin and a raised white blood cell count which I've had consistently since I started seeing my GP over a decade ago.

In all the scopes and scans we've only identified external and internal hemorrhoids, Fatty Liver, and PCOS, all of which we knew about.

During and after all these tests. The fourth doctor repeatedly told me I did not have IBD. That they had tested and confirmed I didn't have it in the beginning, despite all of my symptoms aligning with IBD perfectly. The gastro surgeon also believes I don't have it, but was surprised by it, as he agrees my symptoms are very on point for IBD. The hematologist and my GP respectively remained neutral and trusted in the Gastroenterologist's opinions while also voicing concerns to keep looking into it.

I assume the decision to reject a IBD diagnosis was because we had never, until today, found any signs of inflammation anywhere during scans and scopes.

But that changed after yet another trip to the hospital last night for abdominal pain. A CT without contrast showed inflammation in the intestine (I forgot to ask small or large) with the ER doctor saying it looked consistent to what would be expected for IBD and would explain my symptoms.

They also discovered I had a bladder infection, which they found odd since I had no symptoms of one.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously, but rather I want to understand what goes into the decision to diagnosis a patient with IBD or to say someone doesn't have it.

It was to my understanding that diagnosing IBD was a matter of collecting evidence over time, and that it could be difficult to rule out or diagnosis due to the nature of the inflammation coming and going. From what I could find there isn't just a blood test that says ""confirmed"". That if anything, having a raised white blood cell count chronically could hint at immune system related conditions.

I'm on alot of meds for a lot of things, which I'll list at the bottom, but I just want to know what's going on with my body and I'm struggling to understand my doctors. I don't doubt their experience and education, but I'm wary by how quickly IBD was ruled out at the very beginning.

Help appreciated!

The last week has been brutal with work and I haven't been sleeping enough. Yesterday I had a horrible panic attack and migraine and took 3 advil to help the headache (big mistake). I finally had some time to sleep, slept 15 hours last night and still feel fatigued. Woke up with severe rectal bleeding and constipation--like blood is just coming out, no stool.

I'm not convinced that my fatigue and bleeding are just fissure-related; the amount of blood just seem to make that unlikely, from everything I've read. My doc told me to take miralax to help with the constipation. But I'm scared to do that if I'm flaring.

Night before: unusual heavy alcohol consumption (mostly strong liquor shots and some beer), which I only do on rare occasions ‚Äî no more than 3‚Äì4 times per year, and only during specific events.

Next morning: blood pressure was normal upon waking and remained normal 2 hours later. No symptoms, calm digestion, no noticeable stress response.

After 3 hours: first food intake ‚Äî 4 pieces of broccoli.

15‚Äì30 minutes after ingestion: sudden onset of chest tightness, palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a spike in blood pressure to 160/110.

Treatment: intake of 1g paracetamol ‚Üí significant relief in visceral discomfort and blood pressure returned to normal within the next hour.

Important context:

The first two times, I went to the ER fearing a cardiac issue.

Full cardiac evaluations were performed, including ECG, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Holter), and an exercise stress test ‚Äî all results were excellent, with no abnormalities found.

At the ER, I was NOT given any paracetamol, I was given Tranxilium (clorazepate) for suspected anxiety and Tramadol for pain ‚Äî but I wasn‚Äôt panicking at the time. I was calm, just in intense physical discomfort. Neither medication helped, and the high blood pressure persisted for the rest of the day, only normalizing after sleep.

During the third and fourth episodes, I noticed a consistent pattern: as long as I didn‚Äôt eat, my blood pressure stayed normal and I had no symptoms ‚Äî except maybe a little stomach discomfort from the alcohol hangover. But once I ate ‚Äî even a small amount ‚Äî the same strong symptoms returned.

I have a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn‚Äôs disease, currently treated with Entyvio infusions every two months, but it has been perfectly stable, with no flare-ups or symptoms for over 10 years.

I now suspect Roemheld Syndrome may be involved ‚Äî especially since when I eat large meals, I often experience a sensation of fullness not only in the stomach but also in the center of the chest.

I‚Äôve also noticed that talking for several minutes without pause, even just reading a book aloud alone, can lead to a similar sensation of fullness or pressure in the chest a few minutes later ‚Äî even without food.

I have an upcoming appointment with my gastroenterologist, but I‚Äôd like to gather other perspectives in the meantime to better understand what might be going on.

Questions:

\- Could this be Roemheld Syndrome triggered by gastric distension and vagal irritation, potentially worsened by prior alcohol intake or gut sensitivity?

\- Why would paracetamol (1g) relieve both the visceral symptoms and the high blood pressure, while benzodiazepines and opioids given at the ER didn‚Äôt do anything?

\- Could the diaphragm be involved in some way ‚Äî especially since the same symptom, only the sensation of fullness in the chest (and not the hangover + food intakes symptoms) can appear just from extended talking or reading aloud?

Any insights or related experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

1l10bto,AskDocs,"31M ‚Äì Chronic colon hypersensitivity, fatigue, bloating, calprotectin up to 400, 2 negative colonoscopies ‚Äì Crohn‚Äôs, IBS, SIBO, or something else?","Hi Docs,

I‚Äôm a 31-year-old male with a 15+ year history of debilitating gut symptoms, and despite extensive testing and multiple specialists, I still have no clear diagnosis. I‚Äôm writing here in the hope that a fresh, thorough perspective might help guide my next steps.

‚∏ª

üìå Primary Complaint

A persistent, localized awareness of my colon, felt mostly:
	‚Ä¢	In the upper right quadrant (near the liver),
	‚Ä¢	Center (transverse colon), and
	‚Ä¢	Upper left quadrant (splenic flexure).

The sensation is hard to describe but best compared to post-burn skin: hypersensitive, not sharply painful but extremely uncomfortable.
It becomes worse:
	‚Ä¢	When I stand for long periods,
	‚Ä¢	When I cough,
	‚Ä¢	Or when I squeeze my abdominal muscles.

Sometimes the discomfort moves between locations. The sensation is always in the colon, not the small intestine or stomach. This has persisted daily since high school.

‚∏ª

üîÑ Other Symptoms
	‚Ä¢	Bloating (daily, moderate to severe), often triggered by food, worsens as the day progresses.
	‚Ä¢	Feeling of incomplete evacuation after bowel movements.
	‚Ä¢	Fatigue and brain fog, worse after meals or light workouts.
	‚Ä¢	Occasional small joint pain (mostly hands).
	‚Ä¢	Past episodes (more common in earlier years) with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever.
	‚Ä¢	No visible blood or mucus in stool.

‚∏ª

üß™ Relevant Diagnostics

1. Colonoscopies:
	‚Ä¢	2019: 5 biopsies taken (likely from terminal ileum & colon) ‚Üí negative for Crohn‚Äôs or colitis.
	‚Ä¢	2023: Visual exam normal ‚Üí no biopsies taken.

2. Fecal Calprotectin:
	‚Ä¢	Most tests between 50‚Äì120 Œºg/g.
	‚Ä¢	One episode (while symptomatic) spiked to 400 Œºg/g.

3. Imaging & Other Tests:
	‚Ä¢	MRI Brain: Mild cerebral atrophy (age-inappropriate).
	‚Ä¢	MRI Cervical Spine: Mild C3‚ÄìC4 disc protrusion. Could this affect vagus nerve function?
	‚Ä¢	Liver Ultrasound: Fatty liver, no fibrosis/cirrhosis.
	‚Ä¢	Abdominal ultrasound: No masses, no wall thickening noted.
	‚Ä¢	Planning FibroScan soon.

4. Bloodwork:
	‚Ä¢	HOMA-IR ~5.0, fasting insulin ~20, glucose ~5.7 mmol/L (clear insulin resistance).
	‚Ä¢	Cortisol (8am): 6.03 ¬µg/dL (low-normal).
	‚Ä¢	Testosterone:
	‚Ä¢	2016: 620 ng/dL
	‚Ä¢	2023‚Äì2024: Ranged from 227‚Äì365 ng/dL (free T low-normal).
	‚Ä¢	SHBG: 17‚Äì26 nmol/L (low).
	‚Ä¢	TSH: Ranges from 2.7‚Äì4.0 ¬µIU/mL (possibly subclinical hypothyroidism).
	‚Ä¢	GGT / ALAT: Chronically elevated, even after 2+ months sobriety.
	‚Ä¢	Ferritin: Previously high (~380), now closer to upper normal.

‚∏ª

üíä Current Medications
	‚Ä¢	Mesalazine 500 mg 2‚Äì3x/day ‚Äì prescribed empirically. Improved flares (no fever/diarrhea lately) but hasn‚Äôt touched bloating, hypersensitivity, or fatigue.
	‚Ä¢	Concerta 18 mg for ADD ‚Äì helps slightly with focus, but I remain mentally fatigued.
	‚Ä¢	Metformin XR 750 mg for IR.
	‚Ä¢	Supplements: SAM-e, Omega-3, Tongkat Ali, Maca, Vitamin D, Magnesium, B complex.

‚∏ª

üß¨ Lifestyle & Context
	‚Ä¢	History of heavy alcohol use, now sober (2+ months).
	‚Ä¢	Ex-smoker; currently vaping.
	‚Ä¢	Moderate strength training, minimal cardio.
	‚Ä¢	Poor sleep ‚Äì worsened after evening exercise.
	‚Ä¢	Family history: Mother with Hashimoto‚Äôs; others with metabolic conditions.

‚∏ª

üîç Current Working Hypotheses / Next Tests Planned
	‚Ä¢	Capsule endoscopy to rule out Crohn‚Äôs in small bowel.
	‚Ä¢	SIBO breath test (hydrogen & methane).
	‚Ä¢	ACTH stimulation test to assess adrenal function.
	‚Ä¢	Liver FibroScan to assess fibrosis.
	‚Ä¢	Sleep apnea home study ‚Äì due to fatigue and poor sleep.
	‚Ä¢	Possibly manometry or motility tests.

‚∏ª

‚ùìMy Questions:
	1.	Could this still be Crohn‚Äôs despite clean colonoscopies and biopsies?
	2.	Has anyone seen visceral hypersensitivity this severe in IBS or post-inflammatory bowel disorders?
	3.	Could this be SIBO with symptoms felt only in the colon? Is that common?
	4.	Could cervical spine compression (C3‚ÄìC4) affect vagal tone or gut innervation?
	5.	Does the pattern of elevated calprotectin without overt inflammation or ulcers suggest an early or atypical IBD? Or something like mast cell activation?
	6.	What other rare or overlooked causes of persistent colon hypersensitivity should I investigate?
	7.	Any ideas why coughing or standing worsens the colon pressure sensation?

Had an abdominal ultrasound 3/28 for abdominal pain which showed no issues and common bile duct was only 6mm. 

I was on humira until January when my labs showed no level of medication and hi levels of antibodies, and this is when we switched to skyrizi. It was shortly before this I started to notice that I was having intermittent pains in the area about where my gallbladder used to be. 

The pain is sharp, and it's extreme. It doesn't last for long, less than an hour, and it comes and goes. When it comes though, it's debilitating. I'm also extremely exhausted, more so than I ever have been before.  I've started to feel itchy even though I have no dry skin or rash.

The current plan is to possibly change back to an anti tnf biologic since i had good luck with humira for years, or to add a second biologic, to manage the Crohn's, but I'm concerned that we're missing something with the pain on the right upper quadrant where my liver is. I just can't explain why I would have pain there, and googling scares the daylights out of me

1kxs8as,AskDocs,"Title: 35F ‚Äì Chronic GI Issues, Gallbladder Removed, Elevated ASCA, Dehydration, Now on Prednisone ‚Äì Possible Crohn‚Äôs? IBS? Food Allergy? Seeking clarity.","Hi /AskDocs ‚Äì

I‚Äôm a 35-year-old female, 185 lbs, with a long history of GI issues and a recent flare that led to an ER visit. I'm now on prednisone, trying to stabilize while waiting for an urgent GI referral. I'd appreciate any guidance on what might be going on.

üß¨ Medical Background:
- Endometriosis (surgeries in 2005 & 2007)
- Three full-term pregnancies, no miscarriages
- Gallbladder removed in June 2022 (after third child)
- Septoplasty in June 2022
- Uterine ablation in October 2022 (heavy periods causing anemia) 
- Iron Transfusion in Jan 2023
- Chronic GI issues since teens: bloating, diarrhea, urgency, food intolerance
- On Prilosec for years for gastritis
- Upper endoscopy: showed gastritis, H. pylori negative
- Celiac panel negative
- Joint pain but no skin, eye, or full-body autoimmune symptoms
- Positive ASCA IgG, IgE food allergy panel has high value but nothing shows that they tested for (milk, eggs, nuts, etc)

üìÖ Recent Timeline:
- Mid-April: Flare began ‚Äî severe pain, diarrhea, urgency, nausea
- PCP initially declined GI referral ‚Üí ran labs instead
- Labs came back with elevated ASCA IgG ‚Üí now referred to GI as urgent, still awaiting contact

-ER visit over Memorial Day weekend:
Dehydrated, ketones in urine, mild electrolyte imbalances
- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:
Diverticulosis, no active diverticulitis
3.6 cm right ovarian cyst
Normal appendix, small bowel, colon (no inflammation seen)
- Started prednisone after ER visit (10 mg so far, ongoing)

üíä Current Status:
- Liquid diet for 5+ days ‚Üí improved symptoms
- Carefully reintroducing bland foods (oatmeal, rice) ‚Üí painful gas, belching, cramping (4/10)
No diarrhea, but strong gas and urgency
- Still fatigued, occasional chills, some red skin on chest/face after IV
- Using heating pad to relieve abdominal cramping

‚ùìQuestions:
- Could this still be Crohn‚Äôs, suppressed by liquid diet and steroids?

- Could diverticulosis or IBS cause positive ASCA?

- Is a positive ASCA IgG ever seen with IBS, infections, COVID, autoimmune liver disease, etc.?

- Could I have a non-IgE food intolerance not picked up in allergy panel?

- Will prednisone affect colonoscopy accuracy if inflammation is suppressed?

- Could this be bowel endometriosis presenting similarly to Crohn‚Äôs?

- Should I ask GI to explore SIBO, MCAS, or immune dysregulation?

I feel like the diet and prednisone are reducing symptoms, but masking the underlying issue. It‚Äôs been frustrating waiting for answers, and the cost of testing adds more stress. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience or know what else I should be pushing for, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

1ginph1,AskDocs,Ulcerative colitis flare ,"I am 33, female, and a non smoker. This may be long but I‚Äôve been working myself up about this current flare. I was diagnosed with proctitis back in 2011 with my symptoms being very very mild- just blood and mucus in the stool that was only prevalent during stressful times. I had some very mild flares that were brought under control with a mesalamine suppository within just a few days of taking it. Since 2019 I‚Äôve been on a maintenance dose of oral mesalamine and mini flares were managed with mesalamine suppositories. I just had my second child 7 months ago. While I was pregnant, the manufacturer of my oral mesalamine changed and I started developing cramping when I was having a bowel movement. I went back on the other manufacturer but haven‚Äôt been able to get back to where I was prior to the manufacturer change since. Around 5 months postpartum, I went into my biggest flare ever. I also started drinking coffee at this time which I had stopped drinking in March 2020 (possibly the cause??). I have blood in the stool, lose stools, cramping while going to the bathroom, needing to go 4 times in a row to empty out completely. This is all complicated by the fact that I developed hemorrhoids and a rectocele (stool gets trapped in a pocket in my rectum) following the birth of my first child. I‚Äôm 7 months postpartum now so this flare has been going on for a couple months now. The past few weeks my lower back and hips and legs and knees have started to ache almost like I have the flu. From the posts I‚Äôve read on here it seems like bad flares can cause this type of reaction. I‚Äôve also been super nauseous lately (not pregnant but could be attributed to hormone changes since I‚Äôm 7 months postpartum). I have developed a fear of colon cancer because this flare has so many new symptoms that I‚Äôve never had before. I have a colonoscopy scheduled for January but I‚Äôm on the cancellation list and trying to get it moved up. I have no abdominal pain when I don‚Äôt have to go to the bathroom. Does this all sound like a typical flare or should I be concerned about something worse? I‚Äôm so nervous with having two small children.

I wipe front to back, I keep things clean, etc. Why does this keep happening to me? I‚Äôve done some general googling online, and it looks like there‚Äôs correlation between UC and UTIs?  As per some studies from the NIH that are online. 

Also, I‚Äôm getting married in May. Is it theoretically  possible to have my GP or GI write me a security blanket description of antibiotics that I can take with me on my honeymoon? Is there a preferred antibiotic to use?

1kk2d1c,AskDocs,"I was accused of ‚Äòhealth anxiety‚Äô and then found out I had a hypertonic pelvic floor and IUD in my cervix from another OB. why do some doctors do this to people? (28F, 11w postpartum)","I just would love insight as to why this happens. I came to my original OB genuinely suffering. I had an IUD put in and was having trouble with bowel movements, parts of my vagina feeling different and the anterior wall being more squishy (no prolapse luckily). And was never informed by this OB that I had a hypertonic pelvic floor. Instead, when bringing up my concerns and asking for an exam, I was brushed off as crazy and having health anxiety. I was brushed off as ‚Äòjust being constipated and to eat more prunes‚Äô and to ‚Äòwait 3 months and we‚Äôll see you again‚Äô 

Um, no. 

So I went to a second OB (and now my new OB) and they:

Removed the IUD that had migrated INTO MY CERVIX
Diagnosed with a hypertonic pelvic floor 
Learned why my pelvic floor felt different and was told it had a strong kegel but hard time relaxing 

She took me seriously. But im still dealing a bit with the heartache and second guessing myself after that. I also really cared about my last OB since they helped me through my pregnancy. So I trusted them. A lot. 

Why do some doctors do that to people who actually have something real going on? I know my body and was advocating for myself and I found answers when someone was willing to care.

le317s,AskDocs,I (22M) itched myself a second asshole and I‚Äôm too anxiety ridden to do anything about it.,"TIFU by giving myself a second asshole. NSFW

Obligatory throwaway, you‚Äôll see why.

2 years ago or so ago, i starting having the itchiest fucking spot ever just below my tailbone at the top of my ass crack. It would itch so damn much for no reason and I literally couldn‚Äôt stop myself from itching it, I wasn‚Äôt shoving my hands down my underwear every day either, I was itching it through the top of my jeans which probably fucked me up real good by pushing the fabric of my underwear into my ass avery day.¬†

It got so bad that I would wake up in the middle of the night sometimes and find myself scratching my ass it was so fucking itchy and it would reduce me to tears sometimes. I‚Äôm so embarrassed by this and still to this day have not not told a single person.¬†

Around a year ago whilst I was going for a shit at work I could feel that feces was coming out of 2 holes and the worst part was - I didn‚Äôt even know if this was the first time or if I just hadn‚Äôt noticed it before, because I could only tell it was happening when I was wiping 2 different spots.¬†

My whole ass is just fucked at this point, a year or so on from the first time I did the deed out of 2 holes. I never ever itch it anymore but there is so much tenderness, bloating and god knows how many piles down there from my actual ass hole all the way up to ass hole #2. Good god, there is enough pubic hair attached to my ass right now to cure alopecia in Western Europe, which is honestly the most embarrassing part for me - I do not want anyone to see the absolute bomb site my entire ass is right now. Going for a shit is an absolute nightmare, I normally have to shower after every time, because even after the 10th wipe that paper still ain‚Äôt clean. Wiping 2 holes weirds me out so much. (Although to be fair to asshole #2, a lot less comes out of that one.)

The thought of sitting down with anyone and having to tell them I‚Äôve basically self inflicted an accidental second ass hole over the past year or so is completely and utterly impossible in my brain. I honestly think I‚Äôd rather die than have to sit in a room and tell my family and doctors that. I‚Äôve googled the condition and I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs an ‚ÄòAnal Fistula‚Äô. Basically I am at risk of sepsis if I don‚Äôt get this treated. I‚Äôd honestly rather get rushed to the emergency room for septic shock than have to tell someone about my assholes. So here you go docs, what the fuck do I do? 

‚ÄòJust go to a doctor‚Äô has been running through my head for a year.

1jvqskq,AskDocs,Today a dr told me my high levels of B12 were caused by ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù,"29F, and yep you read the title right.


For context I have been dealing with the following symptoms since November:


-extreme fatigue despite adequate rest

-bone and joint pain, especially in my hips and chest

-constant recurring colds and pneumonia (never has fully gone away, fluctuating)

-reoccurring fevers (usually low grade)

-headaches 

-lack of period (went 18 months no period, came back December 2024, gone again until March 2025)


Last week they ordered a bunch of labs which showed high levels of CRP, GGT and ALK, along with an extremely elevated B-12 Level of over 1000, I do not consume an excess of foods high in B-12, supplement B-12 or drink energy drinks either. I have hashis/hypo but it is well maintained with Synthroid.


Following up with this doctor today, he said that he could ‚Äúsee through my eyes‚Äù that I had a ‚Äútraumatic childhood‚Äù and that all these symptoms are caused by my ‚Äúbad anxiety‚Äù. Then he chalked it all up to that and that concluded the visit.


I have zero complaints about my mental health, I am mentally in the best place I‚Äôve ever been. I see a counsellor regularly. I also DID NOT have a traumatic childhood in the slightest!!


So here I am, hoping someone has some sort of input on why I‚Äôm feeling this way.

1jeappf,AskDocs,I (34F) Had a TIA this weekend and I can‚Äôt shake the anxiety from it all,"Hi there,
I‚Äôm a 34 YO female. I am 7 months PP on my 3rd and final kiddo. Had all three of my children naturally with no complications. I carry about 20 extra LBS from pregnancy but generally pretty ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù No underlying conditions, do not take any regular medication, do not do drugs and rarely drink. No family history of stroke either. Other than just a whole bunch of stress due to having 3 under 3 my life is fairly boring. 

Sunday, I was alone shopping and started having some vision issues. My peripheral vision was blurred, and my direct vision almost looked dark. I could make out what I was looking at, but there was like a darkness to it. About 30 minutes, it was becoming hard for me to articulate my words. I was asking to do a return but could not think of the word return. Overall, felt very off. Upon getting into my car and driving I started to mix of my speech with my husband. And I was even telling him, I‚Äôm talking but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying to you. I was overall super confused and scared. He told me to pull over and call 911 which is when the tingling/started on my tongue, lips and hand. The ambulance got there and took me straight to the ER. 

My labs, chest X-ray and MRI all came back normal. No high cholesterol, no high sugars. I had an echo done yesterday which was also normal. No hole in the heart found. My legs were scanned and no blockages were found. My ER doc called it an unexplainable neuro episode. 

I have an EEG scheduled for tomorrow and a follow up with neuro on Friday. I‚Äôm scared. I have 3 young children and I cannot shake this feeling. I have this overwhelming feeling of doom. Like something is coming. 

As mentioned, I am 7 months PP. my period has returned but I‚Äôm still nursing so I truly believe my hormones are all over the place. I had a friend tell me to make sure I‚Äôm not in any sort of hyper coagulative state.  

I want to cover all my bases which I know will be done in neuro but does anyone have any feedback. Maybe if you‚Äôve seen this? Experienced it? Even if you have a suggestion on what else I can have done/drawn to rule things out. Or even just what to ensure I have done. 

Other than taking this as a wake-up call to take some time for myself to start moving and just taking a breather‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know what else to do.

I want to point I started on adderall again yesterday after taking a tolerance break for 3 days. I usually do this one a month to avoid having a tolerance.

Driving home from work yesterday (3pm) I noted to myself i suddenly felt drunk, I didn't think much because I thought it was sleep deprivation. However when I got to a stop sign, my stomach felt like i was told someone I loved died, my vision went black for a few seconds and my eyes I specifically remember kept twitching side to side. I managed to get home but when I parked I don't remember much. I called my friend to be safe, got into my house and stayed in my room for a bit. While walking I felt drunk, it took a lot for me to not fall and my arms kept twitching uncontrollably.

In my room I specifically remember feeling deja vu, like I've had this episode before and I'm dealing with it again. The issue is I've never had this before. Speaking felt strange and I had my dad take me to the er, while driving I couldn't understand English, or even speak in the waiting room. Anything I said was a stutter of gibberish. I had trouble remembering my name, where I was and what a day of the month it was to the nurses. I kept on looking at my braclet. I  started crying because I was so genuinely confused on what was happening. 

I told this to the doctor, he made me do some basic things (Move arms, legs, walk heel to toe) and I got a cat scan. I was told nothing was wrong and was told at 12am I was just having a panic attack. Nothing let up in those 9 hours. My main concern is this is not a panic attack. I've had these and not once have i experienced the inability to speak properly, nor my body swearing and shaking this bad

I thought sleeping would make it okay, but when I woke up I still have a stutter speaking to anyone, I tried to call my PCP for a follow up and I was repeating sentences and stuttering over basic answers I don't normally do.

qipx5d,AskDocs,"My bf (30M) displays neurological symptoms during ""panic attacks"" lasting hours. Something is very wrong and I'm very scared.","**2021/11/01:** update post ER visit this weekend (see below)

**Summary/tl;dr - Panic attacks with neurological symptoms:**

Reddit, I'm at the end of my fucking rope. Medical professionals are calling my bf's symptoms panic attacks, but I'm convinced he needs a neurologist. I'm a research scientist in mental health (i.e. not a doctor), and my gut keeps telling me something is very wrong. What do you think?

Bf is currently experiencing ‚Äúpanic attacks‚Äù that he barely remembers after they finish. They last 3-6 hours, occur on more than half of the days in a week, and are characterized by extreme anxiety and neurological symptoms such as loss of balance, slurred and slowed speech, mental confusion, memory loss, rapid eye saccades side to side, fainting, and vomiting.

**Background:**

He has a history of childhood abuse and neglect and in general hasn't  seen doctors in his lifetime. Before this started, he had no known conditions but did have a history of anxious and depressive symptoms since adolescence. He's of south asian descent, 5'10, aprox 150lbs, is on 100mg of lyrica, smokes nicotine (\~10 cigarettes a day), 4-7 drinks a week, no other drug use.

**Early 2021 - Symptoms begin:**

He started losing his balance and slurring his speech in the last year, usually either after something extremely stressful (covid and unemployment really got to him) combined with having a beer or two. I thought it was his alcohol tolerance changing with age, so I wasn't too worried. He had several bad falls because of this, broke his glasses twice, needed stitches, etc... stressful but not concerning.

**June 2021 - Symptoms worsen:**

He finally got a job in April, he was super happy. It was a bit stressful and outside his field and had a huge learning curve, but he loved it. But he started losing his balance and slurring his speech more often, even when he hadn't had a drop of alcohol. He also started having full blown panic attacks, where he couldn't breathe, would vomit repeatedly, thought he was dying... I used grounding and breathing techniques to help him through

**July 2021 - Psychiatric emergency room:**

In early July, he couldn't keep food down for 6 days straight and alternated crying and panic attacks. The slurred speech and loss of balance continued. I took him to psychiatric emergency in my city where he was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and put on a low dose (25mg) of seroquel/quetiapine. He was put on sick leave from his job. He was matched with a local psychiatrist, so switched him from seroquel to 50 mg lyrica (~~gabapentin~~ pregabalin\~\~)\~\~ that eventually increased to 150mg.

**August 2021 - Regular emergency room:**

Worst night. After feeling suicidal for the first time in years, he suddenly crashed face first into our shoe rack. Busted his nose open, black eye, full shebang. He was on his back and semi conscious, and couldn't speak. No asymmetry in smile etc but 911 operator and ambulance both suspected a stroke. He got carried out on a stretcher, down the stairs, rushed to ER, and kept for 2 days. He doesn't remember any of this except waking up in the hospital (but he was conscious and speaking/attempting to speak).

MRI negative for stroke, EEG negative for seizure, bloodwork normal. Given one dose of ativan, discharged, told it was ""bad anxiety"", and to keep seeing his psychiatrist.

**Sept 2021-present: medical incompetence??? :**

He saw his psychiatrist 3 days after he was released from the ER. Doc kept him on Lyrica 150 and said ER wasn't concerning since all tests were normal. Asks why bf doesn't want to go back to work yet/is reluctant to extend sick note. Doc refuses to put him on waitlists for therapy, other modalities at the psychiatric hospital, etc... because it's ""not that bad"".

My bf quit his job last week, since he faints at least weekly, vomits 2-3 times a week, and gets these ""panic attacks"" every other day at least (we're currently on day 4 of a long storm).

Second appointment was Tuesday. Doc decided to lower lyrica to 100mg (???) and prescribed Silexan, **a lavender oil extract(?!?!?!)** available from natural food stores. Not available to buy in my country. No pharmacist near us has heard of it. Doc still refuses to do anything else and outright refused ativan when my bf asked for it because it's ""not serious enough"". Next appointment is in over a month. Bf was on the floor half an hour ago and unable to get up.

**Where I'm stuck:**

We're stuck in a loop of ""well, he has a doctor, so go see him"" whenever we consult a nurse, ER, clinic, etc... and a doctor that isn't taking this seriously. We're in Canada (Quebec) with no family doctor and current doc and er won't refer to a neurologist. We've tried putting in a doctor change request but in a strained system it's not going through. I've reached out to work colleagues within mental health research and they can't help/shuttle him in anywhere. Bf is struggling with feeling suicidal/like a burden and I'm scared all the time.

**What I need from you:**

Docs of reddit, what is this!? What do I do??  I'm fucking terrified and I don't think I'm over reacting. Any insight or suggestions are very welcomed.

\[edited to include more background info\]

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

**2021/11/01 Update:**

 we spent the night at the hospital. I got video footage at home, wheeled him in a wheelchair into the ER. He couldn't keep his head up, was drooling, etc... ER didn't believe me he didn't take anything. He had dramatic short term memory problems for hours in the ER (didn't know where he was, kept asking for food even though he wasn't allowed, etc...).

They took blood and urine and did an ekg. All came back negative that I know of. I was kicked out of the room twice for privacy (once being after I asked about a neurology referral) and my bf doesn't remember much of what they told him beyond ""go to therapy and maintain a good lifestyle"". I did ask if they'd considered porphyria (I tried!) but wasn't able to insist they write down the neurology refusal.

Anyway reddit: **thanks for the insights**. You've all been super helpful. The plan now is to request a psych change and try to get a neurology referral from either the new psychiatrist or from a walk in/urgent care clinic.

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a few months ago. I'm a very passive person and I don't like to fight. I was working retail and I got two particularly nasty customers. One was getting mad at me because her total was ""too high"" when in all actuality the numbers were correct. I helped her void things and cancel others to get the number lower. She immediately stopped bullying me as soon as she got word my manager was coming to handle it, and left. I took a 3 minute breather before ringing up more people. 

Less than an hour later, a man walks up. He was holding a lot of drinks in his left arm/hand, and I grabbed them because he looked like he was going to drop it. 9/10 my customer appreciate the help. He didn't like this at all, and started up immediately. He started cursing at me and scolding me like a child, and my anxiety just ramped up. I was trying to hold myself together, so I only nodded when he asked for some cigars. He wanted a bag, so I put the cigars in the bag because most people just want it thrown in one bag. He immediately sighed, slammed his hands on the counter, and asked me (and my manager who come up at this point) how ""fucking smart is that? It'll get crushed blah blah blah blah"" and I instantly burst into tears on the floor and storm into the break room. 

I had one of the most intense panic attacks of my life in the bathroom. I'm used to the trembling, stuttering, numbness in my hands, etc. I was hyperventilating very hard, and it was so bad that my face started to get that pins and needles sensation. I couldn't feel anything else but that specific sensation. I've never quite felt that before. It felt like my face was paralyzed, I saw myself in the mirror and I couldn't really make any facial expressions except the one I had already been making.

a monthish ago, I had what I thought was a panic attack. it started with me feeling shaky (it's hard to describe, but I get this weird tension/shivery feeling sometimes; it happens sometimes when I yawn or get out of bed to use the bathroom or something - I assumed it was cuz I was cold, but it happens sometimes without me feeling cold) which turned into full blown shivers for about an hour and a half. i was so scared I was like dying during this and I physically could not stop shaking. it was like my anxiety about shivering caused me to shiver even more. my teeth were chattering, my thighs and core were shaking - it was super scary. it was hard to walk or talk because I was shaking so hard. i was able to stop shaking like twice for 5 minutes but it just came back.

it eventually went away after taking a Benadryl and an edible and trying to sleep.

prior to that, I did have caffeine for the first time in a couple weeks, and I had it at 8pm which obviously was a bad idea lol. I assumed that triggered it and it was just a weird panic attack (which I get occasionally and have a family history of)

fast fwd to last night: I had a super stressful evening and I had also suddenly stopped Zoloft cold turkey due to refill date issues (which I've fixed as of this morning, but still went without Zoloft for about a week); however, I was calming down and getting ready to fall asleep. i got up to go to the bathroom and felt the sort of tension/shivery feeling and then got scared that another shiver attack was coming on - lo and behold, i did start to have another episode of shivering. same deal: teeth were chattering like crazy, thighs and core were shivering, etc

but this time, I wasn't even panicked. i felt maybe a bit stressed that it was happening, but I didn't feel an adrenaline rush like I did last time and like I normally do with panic attacks. this episode was way shorter. not sure why, but I did try and tell myself to not be scared of the shaking and just let it happen unlike last time where I tried to fight it off

does this sound like a panic attack even if I wasn't feeling panicked? I plan on talking to my gp about it but I wanted to get some input here

i am going through a pretty stressful stretch, and I'm sure being without Zoloft is making it way worse

1m7n14w,AskDocs,Allergic Reactions Panic Attacks (26F),"I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with panic attacks (this May) and allergic asthma from a cat I live with who I‚Äôve been allergic to for almost a decade (2 weeks ago). I think the symptoms from allergic asthma induced so much anxiety it‚Äôs been manifesting into panic attacks although I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in 2 months and I feel like I have been keeping my anxiety at bay through mindfulness based stress reduction. 

I‚Äôve been given hydroxyzine as needed for panic and for allergic asthma: rescue inhaler, maintenance inhaler and I take allegra/nasal spray. 
Epipen prescribed as of today for immunotherapy. 

I got allergy tested the other week and had to be off antihistamines so I moved in with my mom away from my cat so I could be off them. I attended someone‚Äôs house for a bday who had cats and I experienced allergy symptoms despite having just taken my maintenance inhaler. I was there for 5 hours and when I left and was driving home I experienced shallow breathing, had a wave of heat rush over me, and thought I was going to lose consciousness so I took 2 puffs of my rescue. It appeared again a few minutes later so I took another puff and went to the ER. They told me it was allergy related and gave me a steroid shot. All vitals were fine, except high blood pressure.

Today, I went in for my first allergy shot waited my 20 minutes after for any reactions and I got on the highway to go home and had the same symptoms I did a week ago, shallow breathing/feeling like I am going to lose consciousness. I took 2 puffs of my rescue and still was experiencing symptoms and thought I was going to lose control of my car so I took another 2 and called 911. All my vitals were fine. 

I called my allergist and he said it was a panic attack and I should continue immunotherapy.

Now I am even more scared because I have 2 doctors who have told me different diagnoses based on the same symptoms. In my panic attacks I always consistently experience the feeling of my throat closing but I didn‚Äôt experience that today/a week ago. My inhaler alleviating symptoms is also confusing me. Obviously my allergist is a specialist in what allergy symptoms look like so I believe him but I am still scared to continue with these shots in the case it was an allergic reaction.

How do I know which is which?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m7n14w/allergic_reactions_panic_attacks_26f/,1753309013.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1m7bffp,AskDocs,Out of ideas for my panic attacks - long history and a dismissive doctor that refuses to refer out. How do I get help in Ontario?,"I am a 31 year old female in Ontario, Canada. 

My current problem: I have a very long history of trying to get help with my mental health, crises and dismissals from my family doctor. I struggle to cope, keep a job (full-time), maintaining friendships and am in another panic attack induced crisis. (They are beginning to happen every day/multiple times a day again). My partner is becoming burned out over my obsession with trying to stop my panic attacks. I have also been calling into work almost every two weeks from being unable to stop crying/panic attacks and am worried that I will lose my job if I continue this way. I sincerely do not know what to do. I do not have benefits either. 

I have a few diagnoses all mental health related. Here‚Äôs a brief of my most relevant mental health history. (Unfortunately brief is still pretty long). 

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression when I was 12. Diagnosed with ADHD when I was 28. I‚Äôve been having panic attacks since I was 11. Learning disabilities of slow processing speed and issues with my working memory. Recently I would say I am an alcoholic as well. 

In some ways I was lucky - my mom has the diagnoses of chronic anxiety and depression as well. She was able to help me to get help young and I‚Äôve always had her support with panic attacks. 

When I was 12 I became agoraphobic and I really really struggled to leave the house without puking til I was about 17.  I was enrolled in a study for the CBT for youth with anxiety and depression at the Royal Mental Health hospital, I can‚Äôt remember what age but it was extraordinarily helpful. I learned how to cope with my panic attacks at the time and was able to go back to high school (I was getting truancy letters for missing ~30% of school days.). *throughout this time, my family doctor was reluctant to treat me and told my mother I was faking it. It was only because of her stern advocacy that I was able to get help*. During this time I had ideation constantly and was brutally bullied (my anxiety was very visible and made me a target - I was completely and purposefully ostracized) 

I went to university for an Honours Bachelors of Arts in Behavioural Psychology. The relevancy is mostly that I learned a lot about mental health, conditions and treatments. Too much because at some point along the way the panic attacks became overwhelming again from about 20-24. I struggled but kept up. Periodically having times when my anxiety would get so bad I would again struggle to leave the house. My doctor at this time would still dismiss me. 

My father passed away when I was 25. I continued school but ideation returned intrusively to the point where I would be yelling at myself in the car to calm down and trying desperately to fix myself. My panic attacks almost felt like delusions - I started to believe that I was a part of a board game of life and I was one of the pieces that did not want to be there and problems would come up that were all part of the game. Many risky behaviours. A couple attempts, crisis called on me. Panic attacks that would last weeks at a time from the moment I woke til I went to sleep I would be fighting with myself. Derealization was almost constant as well. I had seen 6 different counsellors through this time but for a number of reasons it wouldn‚Äôt stick. This went on til I was about 28. At this point my doctor would try new medications, prescribe them with reluctance and I was always treated like I was an inconvenience. I tried to switch docs but couldn‚Äôt. Anxiety makes it very hard to uphold appointments and when I went I would be dismissed. 

At 28 I basically blew up my life - quit my job in a moment of panic, broke up with my LTR and moved across Ontario. Symptoms got worse and I started to drink a lot - but binging, mostly socially. (I‚Äôve never been able to maintain friendships - unfortunately when my MH gets bad, I will basically drop off and start going on the attack/defense). This didn‚Äôt work out well. About 3 or 4 attempts. 

I moved home, continued trying to get counselling, really pushed my doctor to take my MH seriously. At this point she had been off and returned from her own MH crisis and now believed in my complaints about my own MH. I met a new LTR and I found faith and became stable for about a year and a half. My partner was an alcoholic however; and I started drinking regularly while trying to cope with his alcoholism. Realized that it would help with my panic attacks, and it became a crutch. If I drink then I won‚Äôt care as much and I can go days/weeks without panic attacks. Working casually in group homes so that I could make my own schedule and if my MH declined, then I could adjust my hours accordingly. 

Went back to school trying to continue for my masters in spiritual counselling. Began working full time on a 2 week shift work rotation. Panic attacks returned to basically daily with the stress. 

Broke up with my LTR, quit my full time rotation to go back to controlling my schedule as I was calling in sick too often. Moved by myself. Anxiety up and down, panic attacks up and down and drinking consistently - realizing it became out of control. Had another attempt with lorazepam I bought after my father passed away and had been able to hold onto in case I ever needed to get out of any other bad panic attacks - this time resulting in a day at the hospital. Med change and I was told they couldn‚Äôt send me to a psychiatrist because I had been drinking and I needed to be sober for 6 months. Med change did not really help. I asked my doctor for another med change and my doctor sat googling what medications to try. I asked for a referral and she told me no - she can prescribe and diagnose just as well as a psychiatrist. 

29 - 30 had to moved back home due to my MH struggles and money. Drinking went out of control. I am turning 31 in 8 days. Self referred to addictions treatment. Got a caseworker who believed my diagnoses are wrong and I really needed to be reassessed - however my doctor will not refer. My doctor prescribed me a book to read on how to teach myself that I am safe and that I am an empath who is triggered easily by the environment. I asked about a halter monitor (as I‚Äôve done in the past and was dismissed). She agreed but I missed the dates to have it put on 2x due to work timing and anxiety. My doctor‚Äôs appointment scheduling is 2 1/2 months out. My caseworker moved and dismissed me as a client - sent me to someone else but I was never contacted. 

My Apple Watch that I bought to monitor my heart rate (is feeling like I am having a heart attack all in my head? Yes, I haven‚Äôt died.) and have been getting notifications when I am having a panic attacks that my heart rate is 100-125 when at rest. This is just recent since my daily panic attacks have returned. I have never been tested for heart issues, my BP has usually been okay. I am told my bloodwork is perfect. 

I just looked at my doctor‚Äôs ratings and it is 3/5 stars. Most reviews talk about how my doctor dismisses their legitimate claims and have had real medical emergencies as a result. I am uncertain how to get the care for my MH that is needed but I am desperately tired of panic attacks and have spent the past 2 months calling in sick once every two weeks due to panic attacks and being unable to stop crying. I am worried that I will lose my job but I have not been able to pull it together. I have been sober for 1 week. 

I have done CBT three times, psychotherapy 3 times, addiction treatment, misc therapists‚Ä¶ many times. I meditate, do yoga, active. Eat right.

1lse56t,AskDocs,"Blackouts, skin-crawling sensation, panic attacks, memory gaps, and fear of fainting while riding. What‚Äôs happening to me?","I am \[18M\] around 5'11 and weigh around 70kgs  
I‚Äôve been going through some weird and honestly scary stuff, both physically and mentally, for a while now. It‚Äôs only recently that I started taking it seriously because something happened that made me feel like I might actually be in danger.

Since I was a kid, I‚Äôve had this strange feeling like ants crawling on my skin. It comes and goes, arms, back, legs. I used to think it was just in my head, but once in 5th std, I literally sprayed HIT on my back thinking bugs were there. Even now, I still get the sensation. But here‚Äôs the strange part: when I smoke, the crawling feeling goes away completely for a few hours. That‚Äôs the only reason I started smoking. It made me feel normal. I hate that I rely on it.

In May, while working out at the gym, I was doing bench press with 7.5 kg dumbbells. The next thing I knew, I was doing tricep curls with 12.5 kg. I had no memory of switching. It felt like I suddenly ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù in a different part of my workout. Pls note that i find even 10 kg dumbells difficult for the triceps.  
Also, just last night, I sat down to watch the valorant VCT esports stream at around 11:30 PM on yt in my bedroom lying in my bed. The next clear memory I had was at 5:00 AM, and I was scrolling Instagram in the hall and my phone was on the charge. I don‚Äôt remember when or why I opened instagram  I had deleted the app a week earlier. I only watch four rounds of the match and don‚Äôt remember watching them. That‚Äôs five hours gone, and I have no idea what happened in between. It really scared me. 

I had a panic attack once before in 11th std during a fight with my parents . My left face drooped and I was shaking but after sitting near the window a bit for 10 mins, was better. A year later, five months ago, I fainted while riding my  bike after another fight. Again the left side of my face drooped, and I vomited. Luckily nothing hit me, but I‚Äôm still scared. Since then, I‚Äôve been afraid to ride, especially after a cousin‚Äôs friend recently died in a road accident. A truck ran over him. That really triggered something in me. What if the same thing happens to me if I faint again?

Since May the gym incident, I‚Äôve also often had twitching in my left eyelid . I usually sleep 6 to 7 hours, sometimes more, but these symptoms don‚Äôt go away. thought it is due to my high screen time hence deleted instagram.

I‚Äôm planning to talk to someone I really trust  my childhood tuition teacher, who‚Äôs now pursuing a degree in psychology. She‚Äôs the only person I feel safe opening up to. I haven‚Äôt told my parents because I know they‚Äôll either panic and blame my laptop and phone or just brush it off.

I‚Äôm posting here because I genuinely don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to me. I‚Äôm scared that I might wander off somewhere else which i am really afraid of.

Does this sound neurological or psychological? Or both?  
Should I see a neurologist first or go straight to a therapist?

Is the smoking somehow regulating something in my brain or nerves?

Any advice would be appreciated and thanks in advance.

1lyl3n6,AskDocs,Pretty sure I had a sleep paralysis/ panic attack twice,"So I Male 22 5/10 and 174lbs was chilling with my friends when all of a sudden I was incapable of moving physically to the point that I could barely blink. 

I then noticed that my heart was pumping so hard and so fast that eventually I could feel it getting sore, then I could physically feel my arteries also getting progressively sore. This first ‚Äúepisode‚Äù lasted around 2 to 3 hours. 

During the first ‚Äùepisode‚Äù I could‚Äôve sworn in between my arteries feeling sore and my heart feeling sore, that I could feel something small but squishy move from near my heart to my hand, then back up and as it got closer to my chest it got smaller and smaller until it disappeared. 

During the second ‚Äúepisode‚Äù a couple hours later the same thing happened. My heart pumped hard and fast until it felt sore then it kept going until my arteries felt sore then this whole thing went on for 2 to 3 hours. 

I know it was my arteries because after knowing distinctly were on my body I felt the pumping pain/soreness I could see it was almost the exact same spots were arteries are located. My buddy is emt certified and when I told him what I was experiencing he looked horrified and said it sounded like I had a aneurysm, seizure, heart attack, stroke, blood clot, and a panic attack or anxiety attack 

So basically my emt buddy and the nurse I talked to afterwards were left speechless horrified and surprised that I‚Äôm alive and went through this twice so my question is what happened to me.

My girlfriend helped me through it, and the worst of it only lasted about 5 minutes‚Äîbut I felt completely drained for over an hour afterward.

1lh9k6w,AskDocs,My mom embarrassed me at the doctor- am I gonna be banned from the clinic?,"14f 5‚Äô3 98 pounds 

This is a throwaway, I am super embarrassed and I don‚Äôt want to ever be linked to this. 


Two days ago I had a Dr appointment. Just the regular yearly one. My birthday was 2 weeks ago. 

I was actually kind of waiting for this appointment because there was stuff I wanted to talk about. Ive got a bald spot on my head at the top and it feels like my hair is coming out too much and super dry. I‚Äôm super tired, I‚Äôm getting headaches a lot. I‚Äôm also getting lightheaded when I stand up and feeling fluttery heartbeats. I‚Äôve tried drinking more water but it‚Äôs not helping. So I wanted to talk about that bc I thought maybe I was anemic or had pots or something. 

Anyway, so we get to my appointment and it took a while to get back. My mom was getting more and more upset saying stuff like how they just cram patients in to make money and asking the reception how much longer we had to wait. Then when we finally got back and they took my vitals the nurse asked me how I was feeling because my blood pressure she said was low (102/68) and my pulse (56). I told her I feel fine just tired and my mom instantly goes ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want any medication if you‚Äôre setting up for that‚Äù. The nurse just looked so confused. So that was the first thing. Then when the doctor came in every time I was trying to talk to her my mom would interrupt or make some comment basically accusing the doctor of being trying to make extra money. The doctor asked to talk to me alone and my mom lost it and started yelling about how she wasn‚Äôt going to leave so they could ‚Äúconvince her (me) she‚Äôs sick‚Äù and ‚Äúpump her (me) with drugs‚Äù. I was so embarrassed I was almost crying and I snapped and said ‚Äúmom they probably just want to ask me about sex‚Äù and my mom smacked the back of my head. Literally. Like open hand smacked my head and told me to watch my tone, as if I was the one acting immature. So then everything is quiet and the doctor is just staring. So I said it was fine and my mom could stay. I‚Äôm not sexually active so it was fine. The doctor said she wants to schedule follow up in a week to recheck my vitals, and said the nurse was going to come back in for my HPV shot. So then my mom started yelling again about how ‚Äúwe‚Äù don‚Äôt consent. But *i* want the vaccine. And I said so, and she flicked on the temple IN FRONT OF DOCTOR. AGAIN. And told me to be respectful and shut my mouth. The doctor told her that her behavior wasn‚Äôt appropriate and asked if she needed to call security and my mom shut up. The doctor asked if I wanted to speak alone and I said no because at this point I just want to get out of there and never show my face again. 

We walked out and we were supposed to go to make the follow up appointment and she said we aren‚Äôt because she‚Äôs taking me to a ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù medicine doctor who isn‚Äôt making money from drug companies. What even is functional medicine?? Isn‚Äôt regular doctor medicine functional? I looked it up and it‚Äôs not a free doctor so I don‚Äôt understand the difference. 


Literally, I want to crawl in a hole a die. She wasn‚Äôt like this before. It‚Äôs like the last two years she‚Äôs gone literally insane. And I know she‚Äôs stressed about some stuff but she acted like a fricking lunatic. 

I‚Äôm super embarrassed. And now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to get banned from the clinic because of how my mom acted. And I want to be able to go back because I want to get the hpv vaccine. I don‚Äôt want cancer. And I didn‚Äôt even get to ask about my symptoms because my mom wouldn‚Äôt stop ranting like a crazy woman. She looked like those insane people on TikTok at airports. Seriously it was like she was on crack or something. 

Have any doctors had patients with crazy parents? Can I still go back to the clinic if I ask my dad to bring me or a friends mom or something? And is my doctor going to think I‚Äôm nuts too. I feel actually sick to my stomach thinking about the appointment. I‚Äôm so upset she did that.

1lerp3e,AskDocs,"My wife [37F] gets confused, stumbles over her words in the evenings on a regular basis","Hello,

Since at least October 2024, my wife \[37F\] has been exhibiting some strange symptoms most evenings.

* Starts off a bit hyper, like the thing she's currently doing is the most important thing ever and she's fully into it
   * Might sound benign, but includes things like making exaggerated hand gestures when she's looking for something, or getting super emotionally invested in something one of our kids has said
* Asks the same question multiple times/talks about the same topic multiple times
* Her posture changes, like she struggles to hold her head up normally - she's often leaning her chin towards her chest
* (Sometimes that's all it is on a good night - maybe one in five is a good night)
* Then it degrades further into tripping up over her own words, which she attempts to repeat when she knows she's got something wrong
* She gets confused and doesn't seem to know what's going on
* And the troubles with words can get even worse, like she's clearly trying to talk but it's not making any sense at all, or unable to say a single word properly - but she doesn't know she's doing it and can't understand why nobody understands her
   * The thing that prompted me to make this post tonight was her inability to say ""geometry"". I started recording a video to show her in the morning, where she tries about 20 times to say the word, and by the end, is satisfied she's got it correct, but it's still totally wrong
* She can also get incredibly clumsy and unbalanced, but that seems rarer. One time, she had a nasty fall getting out of the shower and put her foot through the wall

She's fine again by the following morning, but often doesn't remember much of the above. I've resorted to videoing some of the more extreme verbal examples to play back for her the next day. She had no recollection of the shower incident.

When she's really bad, she often gets very tired and can go to bed around 7pm. Sometimes she will sleep right through until morning, but sometimes she will wake up later in the evening, at which point she's trending back to normal.

At first, I assumed she was secretly drinking, but I'm pretty confident I've ruled that out. I said this has been going on since at least October because I've been keeping a sort of diary of her symptoms which goes back that far (so it probably was going on before that too, as it would have taken me a while to decide to start logging it). I started off writing a few sentences each time it was really bad, but have now resorted to just logging the dates when something is off, and it's like 80-90% of the time.

She has been to see the doctor, who has done some routine blood tests twice now which showed nothing much out of the ordinary (first tests showed low folate, but that's now sorted). His theory is that it's more than likely psychological, but he wants to make a neuro referral just in case. Apparently the neuro folks agree that it's likely psychological, but it's just odd enough that they want to get involved. But her appointment with them isn't for another six weeks or so. In the mean time, I keep logging almost every day in my diary. NB: I've also shown the videos I've taken to that doctor, so he's aware of the issue (and very much agrees that the contents of the videos are not normal!)

Background: My wife is currently on a fairly low dose of escitalopram for her anxiety issues, and regularly takes co-codamol for a bad back. She also likely has undiagnosed ADHD. She has also recently started taking some vitamins/supplements after her first set of blood tests showed low folate levels: specifically a multi-vitamin tablet, vitamin D, evening primrose oil, folic acid. None of these have helped, nor have they made it any worse, as far as I can tell.

One more bit of info: If it IS psychological, it's not JUST caused by tiredness or stress. It always seems to start when we're at home and she has some unstructured time, after she finishes work around 3pm, where she catches up on misc jobs around the house (cooking dinner, making the kids their packed lunch, sorting laundry, etc). If she has no choice about what she's doing - e.g. we're out on a trip, we're taking a long car ride, etc - then this NEVER happens, even when the activity she's doing is more stressful and more tiring than normal everyday life. In these circumstances, she's ""with it"" right up until she falls asleep, no matter how tired she is. One more piece of evidence to support this is that she works in a school, and when the school is closed for the holidays, these symptoms have started even earlier in the day, due to more unstructured time available to her.

So, any idea what might be going on? Is a psychological cause more likely than anything else?

I'm realllllllly worried and don't really know how to handle it. It's causing me an immense amount of stress.

Thanks very much in advance for any insight you can provide!

PS: I'm keenly aware this sounds like she's drinking. But I really don't think that's the case - I've been keeping an eye on the amount of alcohol coming into the house, and an eye generally on our spending (we have a joint bank account). Nothing out of the ordinary is happening. I also bought a breathalyser, and she blew negative once when she was showing some pretty severe symptoms.

Symptoms include extreme fatigue, brain fog, occasional fainting, muscle and joint pain, cardiac issues - palpitations will come on out of nowhere accompanied by chest pain and feeling faint or hot or short of breath, sometimes with a weird sensation in my jaw and calf pain. Last time I called my cardiologist and they sent me to ER check for clot or heart attack and everything was normal  ( have an ILR placed but haven‚Äôt caught a fainting episode on it yet. Just tachycardia and SVT according to chart I have also had a few days of my HR spiking for long periods of time when I am not doing any physical activity) 

pain is largely in the neck and back but happens all over, chronic migraines for years, neck pain and migraines will trigger each other, sometimes end up needing to have toradol for spasms or migraines that won‚Äôt go away with abortive.  horrible circulation, vericose and spider veins in my legs, hands and feet turn purple and I am cold often. Thyroid has been checked and is okay. 

This question may be unrelated but I don‚Äôt feel like it is due to the fact that I did not stress my thumb when this happened. I was holding my dogs leash, but he wasn‚Äôt pulling me. Sharp pain came out of nowhere and suddenly I didn‚Äôt have full range of motion in my thumb. 

After a while the pain spike went away but now I cannot but my thumb in an L position, an OK position, or put it upward for a thumbs up. I can bend the top of it only. It looks different than my other hand with a weird pit by my thumb by my wrist. A few hours later I noticed numbness in my ring and pinky finger that went away eventually. I tried to make an OK and found the opposite side of my wrist hurt as well as my thumb. Later I now am seeing swelling on that side of my wrist in a circle over that joint.

What could I have done? Photos in comments. 
Do you think this is normal when I didn‚Äôt stress it or possibly related to the rest of my symptoms? 
What do you think my other symptoms may be? 
Should I be rushing to the doctor or is it okay to book an appt and see how it progresses?

My child is a 7 year old male who was born with right side hydronephrosis. He has been monitored since he was a baby, but we went about 4 years with no imaging due to a doctor we saw who did not feel it was necessary. Fast forward to last week, I finally got in with a doctor who was able to refer me to get him an updated ultrasound and check up. We had the ultrasound today but our follow up consult is not until May. We got ultrasound results same day and I am concerned. The results seem like they are bad, and in trying to look up some of it, actually stressed me out even more. 

Is there anyone in this forum who would be able to help me better understand what I‚Äôm reading? üôèüèº I have copy/pasted the notes on the report below.

I wanted to check here because the doctor I just went and got a check up with recommended I see an ENT. Since I was 20 years old (a sophomore in college) I have been getting ulcers in the back of my throat. I‚Äôve noticed that they tend to arrive when I have severe stress. I have a history of severe anxiety and had an eating disorder from 19-21. I used to take lexapro, then Zoloft, then I went to therapy and now rely on behavioral techniques and exercise. I haven‚Äôt taken meds for about 3 years. Usually I get these ulcers 4-5x a year. They go away on their own, they are just very annoying because it can be irritating when I swallow. It looks similar to strep throat but I ALWAYS get tested when it shows up and it has always been negative. I also rarely have other symptoms with it, and if I do it‚Äôs because I have something else too (ex: one time I had Covid-19 & the stress ulcers at the same time). I haven‚Äôt had strep since I was a teenager. Personally, I take it as a sign from my body that I‚Äôm working myself to hard or that I need to focus on prioritizing my peace (ex: staying up too late, doing too many tasks, not focusing on self-care, etc). Is there any reason I should be worried about this long term, could this be caused from something other than stress, and has anyone else ever seen or had stress ulcers in their throat? Note: the ulcers/sores are always in my throat, never my mouth/cheeks, and every doctor I have seen has told me it does not look like oral herpes (was my initial concern), and it looks the most like strep.

1led6hs,AskDocs,Is it normal for a doctor to dismiss stress-related medical leave even with serious symptoms?,"Hi everyone,

30M

I wanted to share an upsetting experience I recently had with my family doctor and get some insight on whether this kind of reaction is considered normal in the medical field.

I work in a high-pressure customer service environment, and the chronic stress has started affecting me both mentally and physically. I‚Äôve had multiple anxiety attacks while speaking to customers, to the point where my heart races, I feel dizzy, and I can‚Äôt concentrate. I also suffer from IBS, and the stress causes frequent flare-ups that have me rushing to the washroom during work hours. It‚Äôs becoming unmanageable.

To make things worse, my recent blood work shows I‚Äôm now pre-diabetic. I‚Äôm deeply concerned about the toll this job is taking on my health. I decided to visit my family doctor to ask for a short medical leave, not for time off to relax or vacation, but simply to stabilize and recover. I was even willing to go unpaid for part of that time.

Instead of listening or showing any compassion, my doctor became combative. He refused to provide a note for leave and said things like: 

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do after the leave? You‚Äôll just be stressed again.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving you time off to go on vacation.‚Äù

He was extremely dismissive and told me that taking leave won‚Äôt help unless I quit my job. He said I need to show him job interviews lined up before he‚Äôll consider giving me any stress relief or medical leave.

One of the most upsetting parts of the consultation was when he told me, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt handle the stress of North America, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù As an immigrant, this comment felt incredibly dismissive and borderline xenophobic. I came to him for support with my health, not to be judged for where I live or where I come from. I was looking for compassion, not condescension.

He didn‚Äôt ask any questions about my symptoms or try to understand my situation. He just quickly prescribed antidepressants and dismissed the idea of medical leave entirely. I left feeling humiliated and defeated.

Has anyone else faced something like this? Is it normal for a doctor to push you to leave your job and prove you‚Äôre job hunting before approving stress leave?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1led6hs/is_it_normal_for_a_doctor_to_dismiss/,1750240754.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1lryzia,AskDocs,"Need some help,stressed and anxious","33M

Recently visited my GP with concerns of my ankle swelling/calf snd foot swelling.

I am overweight
I was taking Vyvanse and testosterone  (prescribed not blackmarket) before the visit,but after the visit my Dr was alarmed ,my BP was almost 200 each time he did my pressure 186/196/198 were the three results.

And because I take regular blood tests for the testosterone injections, he was able to see my cholesterol levels were in the normal range,kidney and liver function was good and my sugar levels were good..

He then proceeded to tell me that there is always a underlying cause for this level of blood pressure (i said cause im fat) ,I asked if the test caused that high of a BP and he said no ,but Google says different..I was referred to a endocrinologist but because I live in Canada waiting for a specialist tskes up to a year.

So anyways he says im too young to be this big (390lb) and hes generally worried..he prescribed me water pills and BP meds to see if we can drop it..also referred me to cardiologist which has responded and I have a appointment next month (aug 25) and reffered me to obesity clinic and some more lab work,which im doing Tomorrow..

So if my sugars and cholesterol are fine and my kidneys and liver are good...it has to be my weight? I'm not sure he doesn't know..I just need a voice of reason to say its probably not as bad as I think, but I believe its juat me being overweight..

My lab tests tomorrow are ecg/urine and blood

I have this hunch my doctor and I are having a cultural disconnect. She had me walk through a typical day in my life since I mentioned sleep issues to her. I told her I sleep during the work day (remote work ftw) and my screen time. I spend almost all hours on my devices but I am in tech so to be fair this feels reasonable.

She also asked about social stuff and substances and I told her that I see friends when I can and that Im a zynner like snus pouches and that I drink occasionally. I do drink during the work day but did not want to mention this to her. 

She was uninterested in really trying to help with my sleep issues because she said this was indicative of depression.

However...I do not feel depressed in the slightest. I am happy with my lifestyle and it is the exact same as all the twenty somethings I know. Is a second opinion warranted to get help with my sleep problems?

ju4mua,AskDocs,"41yo suboxone patient with lung cancer. I don't mean to keep pestering this sub, but I thought I'd drop in to say good-bye. The cancer is in my heart and central cardiovascular area. It's over.","Hello all. I hope this update doesn't break any rules, as I suppose I do not have any questions. Mods, let me know. I did not want to just disappear from reddit. I know a number of you have been thinking about me.

I said I would post an update before I passed away and, well, here I am. I know it is fast. But things have been happening fast. I don't mean to flood this sub with my misery. I'm on some heavy duty medications. I hope this doesn't come off as rambling.

This will be my final post. The Cancer is all through both sides of my chest and above my collarbone. It's over.

I was diagnosed with Extensive Stage small cell lung cancer and given four months to live on the 6th. Well, it seems ""two weeks"" was a more accurate approximation of my time. I am not long for this world. 

As for what happened-- I wasn't slated to meet my hospice team till yesterday, Friday. I went to the ER on Thursday with chest pain. They took a lot of fluid out of my chest. The ER physician described my imaging as ""grotesque"" and immediately asked if I had considered palliation. I said I didn't see hospice till tomorrow. He said if I wanted any chance of dying at home, I needed to see them NOW, otherwise he'd have to admit me. He won't be getting any awards for bedside manner any time soon, but I greatly appreciated his candor. Several urgent phone calls later I had a palliative Nurse Practitioner in my room who went through the screening process and admitted me to their home hospice program. I went home Friday morning with a hospice kit. Met the palliative physician that evening, shortly after I posted my list of questions here.

I will not see Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even next weekend. Every breath is work. Each one more work than the last. My team estimates that, at this rate, I will die Tuesday at the absolute latest. Probably sooner. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tonight.

My oncologist called to personally apologize for misjudging my remaining time, but I hold him no ill will. Determining the time of death is not an exact science. I know that. I'm arranging to donate my body to science. I want them to do an autopsy and see how it got me so quickly, to help other cancer patients. The oncologist thinks the cancer may have gotten to my heart or the major central blood vessels. I didn't think small cell could move THIS fast but my oncologist says we caught it late. 

My hospice team has been wonderful. I have crossed tapered from bupenorphine-- which I discontinued Wednesday-- to methadone, with little difficulty. I have a lot of morphine and the option of hydromorphone is on the table as well if needed. I am comfortable and resting at home. 

The next stop on the train is continuous sedation, and I am very tired, so I probably will not be able to respond to anyone like I did last time. My physician says we can start a midazolam drip as soon as tonight. I will probably take him up on the offer tomorrow, if I'm still alive.

I suppose this is a good place to share where my fears around palliation come from. I used to be an aid in a nursing home, many years ago. I saw a number of unpleasant deaths due to insufficient palliation. We had a wonderful man who was prescribed a self administration pump for morphine. Problem was, he was too sick to press it, and his physician did not seem to grasp the severity of his condition. Every half hour, one of us would sneak in and press the button on his pump, which, in hindsight, was probably illegal, but what else could we do? He was very uncomfortable at the end. I tried to do basic mouth care just before he passed and he recoiled in pain. ""Have a heart"", he whispered. It broke my heart to hear this admonition from such a wonderful man.

My greatest fear was Terminal Restlessness. I saw a few patients scratch their faces and tear their fingernails out as they died, even on high doses of opioids and benzodiazepines. My palliative physician has assured me that he won't let that happen and that there is no limit to what they can give me. I feel much reassured.

I have tried to write letters to the people I've wronged. I suddenly find that I want to make amends. So many letters. I was a functioning addict for a long time. My family cut me off, rightfully so. So I have been writing a lot of letters. But I am losing strength. I will not be able to write many more letters. My CNA has transcribed one letter template for everyone. I hope it is enough. 

I also had many kind offers to transcribe letters from Redditors here on the sub. What love that you would do that for a stranger. If I was strong enough to talk on the phone, I would have taken you all up on it, but I can barely talk. Perhaps, had I not been so stunned by my diagnosis, I could have arranged this sooner. But that is in the past now.

Dad, if you somehow see this post, I know how much I hurt you and and I am sorry. I wish I could call you. I do not even know where you live and I'm not strong enough to find you. I do not ask for your love, for that is beyond my power to ask. Just your forgiveness is enough. Please Dad, forgive me. I do not want die without your forgiveness. But I will, won't I?

I beseech you all to make amends with those you begrudge. Do not go to bed angry or hold hate in your heart. You will be glad that you forgave. I wish I had done so sooner, before I ran out of time. You will run out of time, too, some day in the future. Don't leave any business unfinished, any grudge unmended.

There a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made. You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.

As difficult and shocking as these last few weeks have been, I regard them as positive.

Only four weeks ago, I thought that the universe was a cold and cruel place. I experienced physical and mental abuse, chronic pain, and addiction. But my situation has forced a change of perspective. I see now that all our experiences, no matter how horrid, are temporary, and that we will all find the same rest and peace in the end. 

I do not mean to give the wrong impression to those struggling with depression. I have tried to kill myself before. The difference between then and now is vast. Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life. It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness. I know there is no magic fix for depression, but I urge you to get up, go out, and live the crazy, wonderful, irrational, beautiful life you want. If only I had done the same. What a gift is life! 

Thank you all for your love, empathy, and reassurance. For all the people who PMed me offering to help with transcribing letters, for all the kind messages and comments. You are all beautiful people. I hope you remember that. No matter what anyone else says or thinks, or even what you yourself think, you are beautiful and can only be so, because you reached out to a stranger in his moment of pain. Your hearts will always carry that little light of goodness no matter how dark your days. Carry that little light with you and forget it not. It can brighten a stranger's day. It can even save the world.

A few PMed me asking to look into their religion. In the past I would have been irritated. Now I recognize that you were concerned for my souls well being. Thank you for your compassion. I am not well versed on religion, but I have prayed, and I trust that whatever higher power may dwell above the stars will look upon my situation with infinite love and compassion. This in my heart I know.

/u/hugegrape, you wanted to make me a plushie free of charge. Your care and empathy have touched my heart. I'm sorry to say that I will not be in a position to receive it. I did not expect to go this fast. I want you to make it anyway. I want you to keep it with you and know that you will always have a part of me. I hope this brings you some comfort. You have my everlasting love and gratitude.

Wishes are usually reserved for the future. I have no future. But I find myself still wishing. 

I wish I had not worried so much about the little things. I wish I had not worried so much about the numbers in my bank account or the punch of the time clock. All that time working. I had enough money to keep a roof over my head and to invest in what few hobbies I had, yet I still kept racking up overtime. And for what? Only to find myself here. It all came to nothing in the end. I robbed myself of the most precious commodity I had, time, in exchange for green pieces of paper and little metal discs. A perverse and twisted trade. Only now do I see the truth.

I wish I had had the courage to live my life the way I wanted to. I wish I had traveled the world, fallen in love, written a novel. I wish I had had children. I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons. No one to sit by my side, here at the end of my world. It is too late for me. But it is not too late for you. Live the life YOU want, no matter how strange it may seem to others or to society. It is your life and yours alone. Live it well.

I'm not sure where I go from here. I have been reading accounts of the afterlife from various cultures. Summerland, Elysium, Tir Na Nog. I've also taken to reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, though it seems I will run out of time before I can finish. What a strange feeling. I personally do not believe consciousness survives death, but I'm open to being pleasantly surprised. And if not, well, who can complain about a siesta that can't be interrupted? Regardless of what awaits me, it is nice to dream.

And that is what I will do now. I will dream. I will rest and dream of the peace to come till I dream no more. May you all one day face death with this same wonderful dream.

I do not have any friends or family to sit here with me, so I am leaving this tab open. I will read your comments and savor your reassurances, even if I do not reply. I will keep you all here with me. I feel less alone this way. I will keep you all with me as I die. You people are all I have now. I am strong but I am scared. Stay with me till I'm gone. I do not want to be alone.

Till we meet again, my beautiful friends.

Talking about toilet, my bowel movements are all over the place. But that could be from my reduced appetite. Though my thirst is greatly increased. I keep drinking or chewing gum because my mouth  just tastes bad if I don't.

I also have been noticing that I shed a lot more hair than I ever used to before.

I also had problems with irregular and/or viciously painful periods before.

Weight: 200lbs 

American 

White Male

Past Medical History: Concussion/GERD/Appendectomy. 

I was a Paramedic for 3 years during the COVID Pandemic. One day, I finally caught COVID from Christ knows where. Immediately after .. I was having episodes of lightheadedness and tachycardia. One day, I fainted and got a concussion. I didn‚Äôt lose consciousness, but the concussion/Covid triggered POTS Syndrome/Visual Snow Syndrome/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I‚Äôve since been bedridden. . . For 2 years. 

Every day .. I‚Äôm in pain. True agony. I can‚Äôt walk because my legs will give out. If I over do it physically or even mentally I will ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù A crash is .. a hell I can‚Äôt even begin to articulate. My whole body is on fire. My brain feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. My pulse sky rockets and maintains in the 130-150 range for hours on end. It feels impossible to even lift my head or breathe properly. This lasts for days or even weeks on end until the crash ‚Äúsubsides.‚Äù My baseline reduces dramatically after a crash. So yes .. with every crash, I get even worse. One day I lose my ability to walk .. then talk .. then eventually, I may lose my ability to eat. This is often the most common way CFS patients die if not by suicide. 

The only way out of a crash is to lay in darkness with no stimulation for days .. or weeks. A different kind of hell. 

I‚Äôve had so many tests .. and besides for a POTS diagnosis .. there seems to be absolutely nothing besides a bullet that can help me. The only medication in the world that helps relieve my symptoms in any fashion is Lorazepam and to a much lesser extent, Clonidine. If I even begin to ask for a higher dose of either, my doctor will wash his hands clean of me. All of this while being told that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúcrisis actor‚Äù by my local politicians. 

Before you suggest it .. yes, I did therapy .. when I still could. It didn‚Äôt help. It didn‚Äôt alleviate the 24/7 perpetual attack upon my body. There is no ‚Äúfinding peace‚Äù with this condition. 

So .. there you have it? This is a final shot in the dark. Is there any hope for me? 

Thank you. 

Edit: Please read before suggesting alternative diagnosis or suggesting this is as simple as an SSRI or a migraine medication: 

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a defining symptom of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). It's characterized by a severe and prolonged worsening of symptoms, or the development of flu-like symptoms, after even minimal physical or mental exertion. PEM is unique because the severity of the malaise and other symptoms are not proportionate to the amount of activity performed. This is the hallmark symptom of CFS that separates it from other conditions. Patients baselines are known to worsen after PEM. It has a lower quality of life index than Schizophrenia or Severe Depression. There is no current FDA approved treatment. Severe CFS patients cannot exercise. When it‚Äôs severe like mine .. they can‚Äôt leave their bed let alone their house. 

Thank you for all of the write ups. Truly. It seems there‚Äôs a depressing lack of understanding for CFS, but regardless .. I appreciate the good faith effort to try and help me. Again, thank you. I‚Äôd reply to all of you right away, but I physically and mentally can‚Äôt process atm. I‚Äôll be back tomorrow. Thank you everyone.

1lkqwzv,AskDocs,Opinions on euthanasia for Alzheimers,"I'm 58M. Anxiety and depression. ADHD. High blood pressure. Gerd. Medication: Vyvanse. 

I watched my mother die from Alzheimers. It was horrific and terrible for everyone involved. She watched her mother die from it and feared it happening to her. My mother did not seem to be aware it was happening to her, even in the early stages.

At 58, I've seen a noticeable decline in my memory and thinking abilities compared to 50. I realize it's early to be considering Alzheimers, but I have risk factors such as family history,  depression, and unfortunately, I hit most of the lifestyle risk factors except smoking and drinking. Given this, making future plans is on my mind. All my family has passed, my niece and her children are all that's left. 

My intention is to make plans now in the event that I am stricken with Alzheimers or otherwise mentally incapacitated. Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands allow euthanasia for dementia. 

After experiencing my mother's agonizing death, I do not wish for my niece to be burdened with me. For me, losing my mental faculties transitions my body to a state where I have lost what it means to be me. As far as I'm concerned, in such a state, I'm already dead but my body is still moving.

My niece has agreed in principle to accommodate my wishes. I'd like to donate my body to science in the country of my death to avoid giving a single cent to the predatory funeral industry. I've worked hard for what I have, and the thought of being out of mind, burning up my estate in a nursing home really pisses me off. I understand medical ethics aren't supposed to take such things into account, but I want to help my niece and avoid needless suffering at the same time. I'm a practical person, it's my guiding philosophy.

I'm just exploring how to practically make this happen, and it seems defining a threshold for competence is not so simple. I realize there are ethical considerations such as my niece deciding to off me for my estate and/or inconvenience sooner rather than later. In my particular situation, I trust my niece completely, and only fear she would wait longer than I prefer. I'd think getting me evaluated by a doctor would be a unbiased determination of my condition to move forward if the time comes. Informing the doctor they'd be essentially signing my death certificate would probably not be a good idea. Involving a doctor in this way without their consent seems like it could be unethical. If I don't have other choices, I'm ok with the doctor never knowing.

I am concerned about any legal consequences to my niece for taking me to be euthanized. The US makes 43% of the world's weapons, but letting helping someone with a terminal illness die with dignity is a bridge too far. My father was dying of liver cancer, and he was in hospice at home. Despite being an avid fisherman, he feared drowning. In the end, as we had been warned, he was slowly drowning with fluid in his lungs. The labored breathing had gone on seemingly forever. We decided as a family to overdose him with the prescibed morphine drops. It didn't take too long after that. My only regret was not doing it sooner. My research regarding so called ""suicide tourism"" doesn't indicate assisting someone is being persued legally, and leaving my body behind makes for a don't ask, don't tell situation. I'm wondering if I could even get an attorney to assist me in planning.

All this is down the road, and hopefully doesn't come to fruition, but I've seen enough to know that this is what I want. I didn't anticipate this being so long, but I think all the pertinent details are included.

What do you think about this? Would your advice be different if it was you? Am I missing a major consideration? Would you be willing to assess a patient knowing your opinion will determine their fate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lkqwzv/opinions_on_euthanasia_for_alzheimers/,1750911893.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
v97z59,AskDocs,"My grandma was thought to have Late Stage Alzheimer's for years. Yesterday, she suddenly ""snapped out of it"". What happened? Are there illnesses that mimic Alzheimer's?","Age: 89
Weight: 120 lbs
Previous health problems: minor UTI 
Location: USA
Duration: 5 years (for Alzheimer's) 

So, I am just perplexed and I have no idea what is going on. My grandmother (who is 89) was thought to have Alzheimer's.My cousin who is a doctor, aunt who is Psychiatrist, mom who is a nurse, and myself (not a medical doctor, but a doctorate in the biological sciences and work in environmental health) all swore by this. Her behavior (inability to have a deep conversation, or respond to her environment, walk to places on her own, mostly reflected this). I say mostly because there was something (in hindsight) that I noticed. When she would see me, she would call me by the pet name that she gave me. In addition, my ex is a nurse who specifically worked with patents with Alzheimers and dementia, and while she said she believed she (my grandmother) had Alzheimer's, she also swore that ""she was there more than we thought she was"".

Anyways, three days ago she went to the hospital due to a UTI infection....and yesterday, I swear it was like none of this happened. She was entirely ""here"". She spoke and had normal conversations like before her diagnosis, she read (like before her diagnosis), she knew about everything happening in the world at this time (her family fled the Iron Curtain so she was interested in Ukraine. She also remembered everything my family would talk with her about when she ""had"" Alzheimer's. Perhaps the strangest thing, is that before, she was a pianist and had a grand piano and would play every night. She played piano...and she played beautifully. 

Look, I may not be a medical doctor, but I am a scientist so I am not going to use the word ""miracle"" but it felt miraculous. At the same time...there has to be an explanation. Obviously in the next few days my family are going to try to figure this out. But in the meantime, I am just left wondering what happened? What did she have beforehand? And why is she suddenly better? It feels like a strange restart in life, like another chance to get to know her and I am simply perplexed.

1lgfgxz,AskDocs,Is this dementia/alzheimers?,"F, 75, ~180lbs. I‚Äôm sorry if this post is a bit long, I‚Äôm completely new to this and desperately need some input. My grandmother, 75, has had plenty of ‚Äúslips‚Äù for years now. Aside from occasionally forgetting her family members‚Äô names, forgetting that she has food cooking and asking visitors what ‚Äúthat smell‚Äù is, forgetting that she put her tea water on until she hears it whistling, she has had multiple occurrences of complete bewilderment while driving where she has absolutely no idea where she is in areas that are very familiar to her. She‚Äôll come to a complete stop in the middle of driving sometimes and ask ‚Äúwhere am I?‚Äù And then continue on way below the speed limit. These driving occurrences have been witnessed when myself or other family members are with her, I can only imagine what it‚Äôs like when she‚Äôs alone. She‚Äôs called me about 3 different times in the last few months telling me she doesn‚Äôt know where she is and she‚Äôll have to tell me what‚Äôs around her so I can figure it out and guide her home using Google maps on my phone.

These are just a few examples. We didn‚Äôt talk for a couple of weeks and she called me panicking saying she hasn‚Äôt seen me in over a year and asked me if I even know my grandfather (her husband) died in January. I played a big role in his final weeks and funeral planning, etc. and spent lots of time with her after that. It hurt me, and honestly was the first time I felt almost disturbed, by her ‚Äúslip up.‚Äù

The problem is, the rest of my [very small] family seems to be almost in denial. Or it‚Äôs as if they‚Äôve gotten so used to it that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust gram being gram.‚Äù But I‚Äôm seriously concerned!! I don‚Äôt think these things are within normal limits of ‚Äúold age slips‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs definitely something more. I have no idea what the first step to all of this is besides her talking to her doctor, which she sometimes she sees as important because I‚Äôve talked to her about how I feel about everything. And other times she makes jokes about how life is better this way being ‚Äúcare free.‚Äù

Honestly, I‚Äôm scared. I feel a responsibility to help as much as I can but I also have multiple young children  of my own that I take care of daily. I don‚Äôt know what level of severity she would be considered to be right now, if she has anything degenerative going on. I asked her to draw a clock that shows 10 past 11, (I know this doesn‚Äôt diagnose anything) and I‚Äôm not sure how to attach photos, but one  clock is more egg shaped and her other clock shows the numbers in the correct order going around, but they‚Äôre a bit askew/sort of floating away from the edges, 6 is more to the side than the bottom etc.

MRI description (ChatGPT translation from other language):
There are periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions, which are indicative of chronic ischemia. Small areas of tissue loss are again seen in the external capsules on both sides and in the right basal ganglia, which may be sequelae of small infarcts. There is also a small area of tissue loss in the left thalamus. There are no acute changes, hemorrhages, or microbleeds. There are no signs of a space-occupying lesion. An arterial angiography of the intracerebral vessels was performed, which shows no clinically significant stenosis. The size and configuration of the ventricular system are unchanged, as is the sulcal pattern.

CAT description (also translated): There are periventricular and subcortical low-density areas, which are indicative of chronic ischemia. There are areas of tissue loss in the external capsules on both sides and in the right basal ganglia, which may be sequelae of previous infarcts. No clearly visible acute changes or signs of a space-occupying lesion are seen. The ventricular system is enlarged, which is a sign of mild central atrophy. There is no mesial temporal atrophy. Cortical atrophy is observed, most pronounced in the parietotemporal regions on both sides (GCA 2). Nothing abnormal is noted on the bone window.

She is carrying belongings, asking to move in, trying to get in the door, claiming she is frightened and is trying to escape...

  I recognise this issue is not mine to solve - her husband needs to be able to make the home secure, and look to ongoing support - but I am looking for help in how to talk to someone in that state to not make them more distressed or confused, and how to encourage them home. Do you go along with the narrative (previously an aggressive lodger, a student that won‚Äôt leave, a boyfriend that isn‚Äôt working out) or do you correct it?

I am medical POA for my widowed, childless aunt.  We started noticing a severe decline in her memory and cognition about 18 months ago, though looking back, there were signs at least five years ago.  She lives on her own, though we are working on getting her into assisted living/ memory care of some kind.  Her short-term memory is VERY poor.  Because of the benign tremor, she has been under the care of her neurologist for several years.  I expressed concerns about her memory and cognition to the neurologist who initiated testing.  She has had an EEG (normal) and head CT (this revealed three tiny bleeds but no evidence of stroke).  Because of family history of lymbic enchaphalitis, she also ordered a lumbar puncture.  Initial results were normal.

My aunt now sees her neurologist as enemy #1. I think because she doesn't understand the cognitive tests, she sees them as insulting and talks about how the doctor treats her as ""less than human.""  For the record, I have been present for the last few appointments, and the doctor has been very kind, patient, and professional.

**TL;DR:** My niece returned from her father's house acting unusually. She stared blankly, gave unrelated answers to questions, and seemed disoriented. After undressing without realizing it, she suddenly had a seizure-like episode and fainted. She's now in the hospital, and we're concerned about what might be happening since she has no prior medical issues.

My niece slept over at her father's house and returned to our home (her grandmother's house) where she lives. As soon as she came back, family members kept asking her questions, but she would just stare and ignore them.

Sometimes, she would blankly stare at the wall, and when she did respond, her answers were completely unrelated to the questions. After a little while, family members became concerned and asked if she even knew where she was or who they were. She answered no. Even when asked what she did that day or where she had gone, she would not know.

After some time, she went upstairs and, at one point, undressed herself without even realizing it, so they had to dress her. Family members kept asking if something had happened on the way or at her father's house, but she just stared at the wall and responded with something else.

Eventually, they brought her downstairs, and she suddenly fell into a seizure-like state with ‚Äòzombie‚Äô noises, her hands tucked into herself until she collapsed and fainted. We called an ambulance, and she is currently in the hospital. Given how challenging hospitals can be here, I wanted to gather some insights in case anyone has a theory about what might be happening.

1iiohyv,AskDocs,Uncle (65m) with Downs and Dementia being put into hospice after just ONE WEEK of refusing food. Is this premature??,"Required Stats: 65 male, no medications, 5'5"" tall and maybe 120 lbs, no smoking, no other medical issues besides Downs and dementia and some random leg swelling, duration 1-2 weeks, a generalized issue (behavioral/neurological)

My 65-year-old uncle has Down syndrome and dementia, which is causing behavioral outbursts. We tried Seroquel, but it made him too sedated to get out of bed so they are wary to continue. Neurology has not presented any other options. Now, he was recently hospitalized for pneumonia. During that time, he began to refuse food. I think that is understandable given the circumstances! I also suspect he is having some difficulty with eating, and that the pneumonia was from aspiration, but Speech won‚Äôt do a swallow study due to his noncompliance. Since he is taking some purees, they also didn‚Äôt place a feeding tube, as they were afraid he would pull it out.

Now, he‚Äôs being discharged back to memory care, where they‚Äôre considering him a **hospice** case - as in, keeping him comfortable but essentially letting him starve! They claim that since he can't be forced to eat, there is nothing they can do besides just presenting food. As a former hospital rehab therapist, this feels premature to me. I've had countless non-compliant patients with dementia, and we had to try many different approaches to get them to eat or do other things. We certainly didn't give up after one week, especially if there were no other terminal health problems. There are also options for tube feeding that have not been considered. But every time I bring it up, I get shut down so forcefully - as if it's completely unheard of to try and rehab him.

Does this feel off to anyone else, and what can we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iiohyv/uncle_65m_with_downs_and_dementia_being_put_into/,1738798803.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
1bww89w,AskDocs,[26F] Showing signs of dementia. Is there any hope for me or chance that I'm wrong?,"26F, 5'7"", 190lbs, Caucasian, extensive list below, some symptoms 2yrs but significantly worsened in the past two weeks, pcos/endometriosis/vitamin d deficiency/moderate sleep apnea, concerta 27mg extended release/vitamin D2 50,000 IU, no drinking/smoking/recreational drugs. Hoping I can get some insight from another neurologist.

Having signs of dementia at only 26, and worried I've been seeing warning signs of it the past two years but passed it off as not having been medicated for my ADHD at the time. Deja vu, cognitive decline, increasing confusion, reduced concentration, feeling withdrawn because my ability to do usual things has been getting worse, feeling like my surroundings are unfamiliar, I can't tell if I'm psyching myself out or if I'm struggling with faces, feeling the need to repeat myself in conversation, and I'm constantly blanking and getting irritated and am hesitant to speak bc I keep having trouble word pulling. I feel less coordinated, too. I've noticed the past few years my vison has gotten worse and I see halos, too.

I tested myself on the SLUMS and MoCa tests yesterday; scored 19-20 and 26. Dementia level on SLUMS and the lowest possible for normal on MoCa.

I'm terrified. I'm afraid I've gone past the point of early diagnosis because myself and my neuro wrote it off as something benign.

Talked to my previous neuro about my deja vu and trouble thinking, but she suspected sleep deprivation from the sleep apnea. She suggested an EEG even though she didn't suspect seizures. Didn't suspect the chance of dementia when I brought it up.

My previous neuro is retiring and I spoke to my new neuro yesterday, and he seemed to just completely brush off my concerns.

I tried to push for a spinal tap to see if I could get some answers. I actually wanted a spinal tap years ago when I was exhibiting unexplained neurological symptoms that seemed to correlate to MS, but things eventually subsided so I left it alone.

New neuro wouldn't budge, saying that because my past two MRI's in 2020 and 2021 have been clear that we didn't need to order that. I asked if there were any tests at all that we could do that ruled out alzheimers or dementia and he seemed baffled and replied with ""20 year olds don't get it.""

I'm already afraid of not being taken seriously by this person. I know the chances are so incredibly low being 26, but my symptoms keep telling me otherwise. I want to improve my lifestyle but I feel the need to focus on ruling out this first and foremost. If that's what's going on, I want to get treatment for it asap.

Focusing now on getting a new neurologist and a second opinion. I feel like something is very wrong.

History:

Great grandmother, grandmother, and uncle on mom's side all have had/have alzheimers or dementia. Great grandmother and grandmother were over 60+ and my uncle who just got recently diagnosed is 65. My mother might be exhibiting signs and she's 65+. My uncle is a war veteran, has drank heavily in the past, has had head injuries, and did drugs. My grandmother had unmanaged diabetes.

I had a minor concussion around in 2014 from falling off my horse.

I have combined ADHD, OCD, PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

I've been taking Concerta Extended Release 27mg for going on three months, and 50,000IU of Vitamin D2 for about four months.

I'm very sedentary and have stayed inside constantly since the pandemic due to derealization when I go out the past two years. I almost never leave my room.

I had a CPAP for a few months but didn't use it enough for my insurance to want to keep paying for it(because I had to switch to a different mask, therefore I wasn't using it for a few weeks until I got a new one.)

I caught COVID back in October after a trip across the US. Up until recently, it's been easy to go into coughing fits from my lungs being irritated, but it's been getting better.

UPDATE: I haven't improved at all since this post, unfortunately. I've only gotten worse, it seems. I've made an appointment with my primary for the 1st of May to get bloodwork done that's required for being referred to a neuro in my area that specializes in neurodegenerative disorders. I'm going to try and get a CT scan tomorrow, and hope and pray that there's no atrophy and that this is all just something reversible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1bww89w/26f_showing_signs_of_dementia_is_there_any_hope/,1712358699.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1ku5ske,AskDocs,i think i‚Äôm either dying or developing dementia at 23,"Age/Sex: 23F
Height/Weight: 164‚Äì167‚ÄØcm, now 40.1‚ÄØkg (BMI ~14.4‚Äì14.9)
Duration of symptoms: 3‚Äì4 weeks
Medications:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉVyvanse 70‚ÄØmg daily (long-term use, 5:00‚ÄØAM)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉBupropion XL 150‚ÄØmg daily (started May 1)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉOccasional zolpidem 10‚ÄØmg for sleep
Relevant history: ADHD, no alcohol since mid April, previously high functioning academically, prone to
raynauds
Recent labs (April): Normal CBC, eGFR 86, ferritin 36, glucose 4.0, HbA1c 5.1%, TSH 1.99, cortisol mildly high (731‚ÄØnmol/L)

I started bupropion XL 150‚ÄØmg on May 1 to help with motivation and smoking cessation. I quit smoking quickly, and my appetite improved slightly at first. But by Day 2, I developed severe fatigue. I assumed it was just accumulated sleep debt, but it never resolved.

Since then my health has completely destabilized:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI‚Äôve lost ~4‚Äì5‚ÄØkg in under a month, now at 40.1‚ÄØkg (BMI < 15)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉMy face is hollow, ribs visible without breathing in, and I have a defined 6-pack from wasting
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉEven when I feel hunger pangs, I have no appetite, and trying to eat makes them vanish. I‚Äôm likely eating <500 calories/day, except yesterday (3 slices of pizza)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉThat night, I had severe heart palpitations while asleep. My Apple Watch recorded HR of 99‚Äì118 BPM for 90+ minutes
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉMy HR varies from 41 to 169 BPM throughout the day; often >120 while sitting still, and I now constantly feel my heart beating
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉNormally my HR drops into the 50s during sleep and I can‚Äôt sleep if it‚Äôs above 60 ‚Äî last night it was over 60 the entire night

I also developed severe cognitive symptoms:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉA week after starting bupropion, I had a memory blackout‚ÄîI stopped tracking sleep, forgot routines, and now struggle to recall even basic things from prior days
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI wake up, sit down to study, and suddenly realize hours passed without knowing what I did
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI went from top of my class to feeling completely incapable
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI can‚Äôt study, can‚Äôt focus, and feel like my brain is leaking out of my head
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI‚Äôve also started to accidentally redose Vyvanse on some days because I couldn‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôd taken it ‚Äî even at 140‚ÄØmg, I felt no effect
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI‚Äôve had a high stimulant tolerance for years, but now it feels like nothing works, and I suspect it‚Äôs dangerous to be on any dose right now
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉMy memory is so bad I‚Äôll forget what I‚Äôm doing as I‚Äôm doing it and have to sit and collect my thoughts
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI‚Äôve also been getting irrationally angry since yesterday ‚Äî everything makes me want to start screaming and punching things. Every little noise sets me off, and when my hair got snagged while brushing it I wanted to beat myself over the head with the brush

Other symptoms:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉNumbness and tingling in hands, arms, legs, and feet ‚Äî even holding a slice of pizza made my hand go numb
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉClammy hands and loss of sensation while writing in exams
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉPersistent headache around left eye and sinuses
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉBreath smells rotten despite quitting smoking and flawless oral hygiene (floss, water pick, tongue scraping)
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉLegs hurt from normal walking, struggled to carry 6kg of laundry, and even my light tote bag feels heavy
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉI have no anxiety, but also no motivation. I don‚Äôt even panic when I waste the day ‚Äî I just sit there dissociated and empty.

All of this began only after starting bupropion. Vyvanse never caused these issues before. My April bloodwork was fine, but this all started afterward.

Is this a bupropion toxicity issue? Should I stop immediately? My first exam is in one week, assuming I‚Äôm even allowed to write it. I feel like my health and cognition have completely collapsed.

I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôll do anything to get my mind back I‚Äôll even get a feeding tube but I can‚Äôt keep living like this I have a week to fix myself or my life is ruined.


TL;DR:

23F, BMI now <15 after losing ~5‚ÄØkg in a month. Started bupropion on May 1. Since then:
	‚Ä¢	Severe fatigue, no appetite, likely eating <500‚ÄØcal/day
	‚Ä¢	Resting HR swinging 41‚Äì169, palpitations during sleep, watch alerting at >100 BPM
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive collapse: memory blackouts, can‚Äôt focus, forgetting what I‚Äôm doing mid-task
	‚Ä¢	Redosed Vyvanse by accident, still felt nothing even at 140‚ÄØmg
	‚Ä¢	Numb limbs, headaches, irrational rage from yesterday, total emotional dysregulation
	‚Ä¢	Feel physically and mentally broken. Previously high-functioning. Need to know if bupropion is causing this and if I should stop now before exams in 1 week

This started only after adding bupropion. Labs from April were normal. I had 5 vitamin b complex and magnesium shots over 2 weeks and did start a sublingual iron supplement (quadrofer)

1lkjvsn,AskDocs,21M asking for my 79 year old grandpa with dementia. How much time does he have left?,"I'm a 21M asking this for my grandpa, who turns 80 in November.

I was first anxious about him back in 2018, where I made a note about his memory loss. His mental deterioration then scared me. It wasn't until close to 2020 when he was fully diagnosed with Dementia.

That same year, in 2020, my grandpa contracted Covid, had a bad fall that led to him passing out, and since then his mental health has gotten much worse.

His sons, my uncles, all have learning disabilities, so he and my grandma (76F) have taken care of them their whole lives. They are now 52, 49, and 48 respectively. He is also the father of my mom, 45F, who does not have learning disabilities the way they do.

My grandpa does not remember who any of them are anymore. Yesterday I took him to get McDonalds, and he said ""I think I may have even eaten here once."" He does not know who I am, and thinks I'm just a caretaker. 

He does not know who my grandma is, at least in reference to him, anymore either. That is to say, he knows her name and knows he likes having her around, but doesn't know they've been married for 55 years, or that she actually lives with him, and isn't just normally around.

I've been keeping care of my grandpa and my uncles for the past few days while my grandma and my sister are on a short vacation. They get back Friday afternoon. Every time he and I talk, he checks his watch repeatedly trying to figure out what day it is, before he forgets it's Wednesday. Then he says ""Wednesday, Thursday, Friday"", and then checks his watch again. He repeatedly says he wonders when they get back, and when I say they get back Friday, the pattern continues.

He repeatedly uses the restroom, and probably goes close to 20 times a day. This is not an issue with his bladder as far as we know, but rather that he gets so nervous that that's where he goes to calm his nerves. 

He doesn't know how the TV remote works. He gets anxious seeing us pour out ketchup because he's scared it'll get everywhere. He calls french fries ""cheese things."" He didn't know how to open a hamburger wrapper and tried to cut it open with a fork when I had stepped away. 

Over 3 years ago I tried to play chess with him, since he has always loved chess and playing board games with me, and he got so upset because he kept forgetting how all the pieces moved after I tried to tell him that I decided to stop playing.

Almost 9 months ago, he woke up my grandma holding all the butterknives he could find, saying he needed to dig those into the ground so no one could break in and attack him. 

He's dealt with dementia for so long, and it's only gotten worse, even with it having been worse for so long. I'm so anxious about it. I love my grandpa so much, and he's always been a perfect role model for me. I have so many great memories with him.

I just want to know if there are any estimates. He's talked a couple times the last few days about how he doesn't know how much longer he can hold on, and how he'll have to go to ""where they dig into the didt and put people into the ground"" soon. How badly he misses his mom and dad but that ""it won't be long before he can see them again."" 

Obviously I don't want him to go, but he struggles so badly every minute of every day. It hurts so bad hearing him talk about all this. I just want to know if there's any guesses as to how much longer he has.

1kj4tdn,AskDocs,Is this dementia?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice or hear from others who might have experienced something similar. For the last couple of months, I‚Äôve been dealing with some pretty persistent symptoms, and I‚Äôm not sure where to turn.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on:

* **Headaches**: They‚Äôve been pretty constant, not excruciating, but always there. Sometimes it feels like a pressure in my head, sometimes more when I bend forward.
* **Brain Fog**: My concentration has been awful. I feel spaced out, forgetful, and like I can‚Äôt focus. It‚Äôs hard to finish tasks, and it feels like my brain is running on a delay.
* **Memory Issues**: Recently, I‚Äôve had these weird gaps where I forget things I did just minutes ago. For example, I went out with friends to play pool today and couldn‚Äôt remember which balls I was supposed to hit or whose turn it was. For like 10 minutes straight (I didn't eat since morning and drank 2 beers, but my brain was never like this) I also sometimes mix up words (like calling a magpie a woodpecker), and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm struggling to follow conversations properly.
* **Fatigue**: I‚Äôve been really tired all the time, even though I‚Äôm getting enough sleep.
* **Mood Issues**: I‚Äôve been feeling down, and I think it‚Äôs affecting my social life too.
* **Other Symptoms**: I‚Äôve had some dizziness and a weird feeling in my stomach, almost like I‚Äôm going to pass out sometimes. It‚Äôs not constant but happens randomly. Especially when turning my head left I noticed it

I had a sinus infection about a month ago and was treated with two rounds of antibiotics, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related.

I know this could be a lot of things, but I‚Äôm really struggling to figure out what‚Äôs going on. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? What did you do to get better? Should I see a specialist or get more tests done?

Potassium deficiency, low blood sugar, or something else?","My Mom(Age: 66, Height: 5'2, Weight: roughly 170lbs, Medications: Metformin, Propranolol, Olmesartan, Glipizide, Lexipro, and Potassium Chloride) has had a slew of health problems since about February of this year when she fell in the night due to a severe drop in blood sugar(she's a type 2 diabetic), luckily I woke up and called an ambulance, but days after this she ended up evidently fracturing her pelvis in a couple spots when she initially fell but just didn't realize it and neither did the paramedics when they came that night after they got her blood sugar back to normal.

Fast forward to about a month ago the pain from that went away and it's healed, however she had a brief spell of pneumonia and a UTI which they prescribed meds for and they've seemingly both gone away. She also was having Potassium deficiency problems again which she hasn't had since 2018. Most of that stuff has appeared to been resolved and she seemed to be doing a lot better and was walking more normal(I've been trying to get her to walk and exercise more of course, but I can only do so much, she can be really stubborn at times.), but as of the past week it's been back to exhaustion and needing me to help her go to the bathroom again.

Furthermore, Thursday of this week she fell again while trying to get up from her couch when I was in the bathroom. She fell on her butt and got back up really fast and didn't seem to have any pain or visible injuries. However she's been having strange confused behavior, memory loss, and being very lethargic. For example, not remembering my birthday or her own, not understanding why she was on the phone with certain people, and as of today forgetting that she had taken her Potassium medication right after she took it.

I would assume the problem is related to the Potassium because she hasn't been taking it due her family doctor not prescribing a refill until Wednesday(the day before she fell) and hasn't taken it since today. I just assume she usually takes all of her medicine on time because she's only been really good about that, but I guess I'm gonna have to start regulating that as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lbevej/my_mom_is_acting_very_lethargic_confused_and/,1749924026.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

**Background**

Dealing with long COVID/chronic fatigue/brain fog for three years now (started after getting the vaccine, following by several times positive for covid).

**symptoms:** ¬†  
\- Always exhausted, foggy-headed during the day, weirdly getting better after 6 PM.  
\- Severe brain fog (mentally slow, memory loss, word-finding issues)  
\- frequent colds  
\- Declining cognitive function

I recently did a full blood panel.¬†Results came back - full list of everything tested at the bottom- mostly normal.

**tldr:**

Thought it might be adrenal or thyroid issues, but those look fine.

The slightly odd things were:

1. ¬†**Ferritin high** \+¬†**Iron saturation low** (suggesting iron deficiency + inflammation?)
2. ¬†**CIK cells high** ( No idea what this means?)
3. ¬†**Anticardiolipin IgM positive**  (how significant is this?)
4. **CH50 (complement) high** (more inflammation?)
5. ¬†**CD4/CD8 ratio = 1.0** (low-normal ‚Üí weak immunity?)
6. Mildly¬†**high lipids** (despite healthy diet)

**My ask:** ¬†  
Has anyone seen similar patterns? Especially:  
\- The¬†ferritin/iron disconnect with normal CRP, ESR ?  
\- Significance of¬†high CIK cells?¬†¬†  
\-¬†CH50 elevation without other inflammation markers?  
\- Would you¬†retest anything before my next appointments with doctor?

**Thank you for reading this.¬†I‚Äôd sincerely appreciate any insights on my test results. :)**

1l8lhwf,AskDocs,Passed out and experienced memory loss.,"Monday evening I decided to take a walk around my neighborhood but that quickly proved to been a very dumb idea because I hadn't ate yet, had only taken a few sips from my water bottle, and it was extremely hot out. To no one's surprise but my own I passed out under these conditions, but during my fall it seems I hit the back of my head (it's been killing me since yesterday.) 

I don't remember passing out, I remember waking up and telling my 7yr old brother to not tell anyone.

From their I don't have a single memory if him and I walking back to the house, and me going up the stairs to my room. During this I messaged my best friend, ""Can you call me. Pls."" And rung her twice with her picking up the second time. She said I was crying and kept repeating I didn't know where I was and that I was confused. I wasn't really making much sense I was just in panic mode. I snapped back to reality about 8 minutes into the call and I remember saying, ""Oh my god, we've been on call for 8 minutes??"" because I was VERY confused on why I was even on the phone with her or why I was in the corner of my room, on the floor, sobbing crying. My head was killing me, I didn't remember the walk I took and at first thought I'd had a nightmare and called my bsf in the middle of it panicking. 

I had to FORCE my brain to remember the events leading up to what I, at first, believed to be a mental breakdown that I had in the middle of my sleep. ( I remember asking my best friend, ""oh my god have I gone crazy??"") Thanks to my photos I could confirm I went on a walk with all the photos I took. That confirmation really calmed me down, helped me realize that I passed out, and I hadn't lost my fucking mind BECAUSE HOLY SHIT DID I FEEL LIKE I WAS.

Genuinely the scariest thing to ever happen to me and I say all this to ask, does this sound like a concussion to anyone? My brother says I fell backwords so I'm assuming that I hit my head pretty hard and the pain I've been feeling since is only confirmation that I did fall and hit thr back of my head. The amnesia I got after that wiped my memory for at least 15 minutes + the temporary memory loss of ALL my memories from that day (and again I STILL HAVE NO MEMORY FROM WAKING UP TO GETTING TO THE CORNER OF MY ROOM CRYING) 

I asked the ER for a CT scan because I was really scared that I possibly have a brain bleed (and still am.) But got politely told that I was, ""To young for a CT."" Wasn't aware there was a age limit to head trauma, and was just give tylenol and sum fluid for the headache which helped a lot but I think it's worn off now. (the headache is also what brings me here, it's killing me rn.) They took my labs, EKG, and a chest ray and said they didn't find anything. They booked me with a follow up exam and a cardiologist exam.

I feel like none of the nurses or doctor who saw me cared about the head injury tbh but to be fair I didn't stress enough how much it was hurting me and at the moment didn't know I fell backwords I really couldn't pinpoint the pain, mt head just hurt. Still does.

Since having my daughter 10 months ago, these kinds of episodes have been increasing in frequency. I was mid-conversation with my husband when it felt like my memory had been completely wiped.

And then it just‚Ä¶came back to me. It‚Äôs happened a few more times where I can‚Äôt remember the layout of my home.

I‚Äôve been taking venlafaxine for about 5 years now and it‚Äôs worked great for me. I also started taking buspirone about a year ago for anxiety/intrusive thoughts.

I had two options ,open the door or look out the window. I chose the window, and instantly everything clicked back into place. The whole episode lasted about a minute.

For context, I have DPDR induced by weed, but it‚Äôs usually only triggered by very specific things and this episode felt¬†*nothing*¬†like that. It was way more sudden and glitchy, like a weird cognitive short-circuit and I'm 25m

19M/ 6ft/ 145lb/ PTSD. 

I‚Äôve been experiencing some concerning new side effects from my medication that are becoming difficult to cope with. Here‚Äôs my current medication schedule:

* 8 AM: Sertraline 50 mg
* 12 PM: Lorazepam 0.5 mg
* 5 PM: Lorazepam 0.5 mg
* 9 PM: Quetiapine 25 mg
* 10 PM: Lorazepam 0.5 mg

I‚Äôm already experiencing a lot of side effects (Lorazepam and sertraline together can further intensify confusions aswell).
I think they have increased my dosage, but I‚Äôm unsure. I‚Äôm under my parents guardianship, and they manage my medication for me.
Recently, I‚Äôve been having some serious new side effects that are hard to cope with. The hardest one is that I‚Äôm having significant difficulty perceiving time. I feel completely lost and struggle to understand it. For example, I might blink and suddenly four hours have passed, or feel like time has shifted. Along with that, I experience blackouts, I‚Äôm conscious and alive, but I can‚Äôt recall 1 or 2 hours of my previous day.
My medications cause me to slightly hallucinate, though it‚Äôs not extreme. But I struggle to figure out whether it‚Äôs a new side effect or actual hallucinations. I‚Äôm really confused. 
Do you have any explanation for that ?

I wrote in my notes that I need to tell my psychologists about these symptoms, but I don‚Äôt remember asking about it or what his response was, because I haven‚Äôt written anything.

Original post: 

Just a resident here so I only have experience with a few hospitals. Hoping to know if what I have been seeing is common. 

For example, for patients on infliximab for IBD or psoriasis who are due for their next infusion and just happen to be hospitalized with a flare at the time are told they can‚Äôt have their medication. We are basically told don‚Äôt even think about starting them on a new biologic while inpatient either because the answer will always be no. 

 I‚Äôve gotten push back followed by hard stops from admin at every turn while trying to get sick patients their medications. I know cost is the reason they use, but these patients aren‚Äôt going to discharge any time soon without their infusions or injections which is going to rack up an even bigger bill.

hr0wim,medicine,Thoughts on a co-pay for frequent ED visits with Medicaid?,"First off, I don't want this to get into a discussion about free health care in the US, this question is based off of our current system. 

What are some thoughts on having a co-pay for being seen in the ED? Nothing expensive, maybe something like 10-$30? Or even, if you've been to ED x times within y amount of time the co-pay kicks in.

Maybe this isn't an issue in other areas, as I work in rural medicine. We only have acute care Sat mornings 9-12. So some people see the ED as extended clinic service. I've literally had a pt in my ED at 10pm on a Sunday on the phone with their family telling them they were at the clinic. 

Anyways, we have ""frequent fliers"" for lack of better term, that come in for the same thing (same HA at 1am etc.) several times a month, And no matter how many conversations are had about appropriate uses of ED vs clinic, they simply don't care because it's free for them. These people have had multiple scans, seen specialists, etc. Maybe it's a wrong mindset, but I feel like it's an abuse of the system. For instance this one pt with history of IBD had 43 encounters, either ED, clinic, or specialist, and 15 scans of which IIRC close to 10 were CT, all within a 6 month period. 

I'd never have want to discourage anyone for seeking out health care as even ""frequent fliers"" have true emergencies, but most of it can wait a few hours until clinic is open. The CYA and EMTALA of ED medicine makes it hard for me to not feel some people abuse the current system. 

Is this prevalent in other areas to where having a slight co-pay for frequent visits would help deter people from using the ED inappropriately?",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/hr0wim/thoughts_on_a_copay_for_frequent_ed_visits_with/,1594730997.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Her school makes her learn bits and pieces of random medicine by being given case presentations and told to figure it out from there. No anat/phys, patho, or pharm classes or background. Just a case, an UTD subscription, and gumption. Anyway, here's one (EDIT: for clarification, this is not a real case and i'm nearly 100% sure this case was written by the dental professors without consulting a physician):

\-------------------

35-yo F (PMHx gluten/lactose sensitivity on no meds, PSHx appendectomy and C-section x2, w/PFHx UC in maternal grandmother, sister who thinks she has Celiac \[never had formal dx\], and father w/CAD/HLD) goes to Cozumel, Mexico and Caribbean for snorkeling. Develops acute, voluminous, watery diarrhoea and then f to 101 F 2 days later. Soon thereafter, starts having 15 small-volume bloody stools/day w/persistent fever. Mexican pharmacy starts her on cipro bid x5days (unknown dosage).

Pt returns to US w/diarrhoea + cramps; now stool soft and mixed w/gross blood and mucus. Fever now \~100.4 F and pt taking scheduled APAP. PCP starts pt on loperamide (max 8 mg/day) on day 10 of illness.

Pt referred to GI, who does flex-sig and colonoscopy showing haemorrhagic colitis w/neg stool studies. Thus, GI starts pt on flagyl for poss giardiasis + *American* cipro for ""mucosally-invasive bacterial diarrhoea"". They also increase pt's Imodium to max 16 mg/day.

GI sx start to improve and resolve, but then pt starts getting tooth pain. Tooth pain resolved, then returned 2 wk later w/L facial swelling and trismus (my words, not theirs). Pt seen by dentist and dx w/Tooth 18 necrotic pulp and apical abscess. Started on amox 500 tid ""until infection gone"". Dentist also does I+D and schedules root canal.

Facial induration worsens. Dentist performs second I+D as well as root canal w/Penrose drain. Fucked up and did root canal on Tooth 19 instead of 18 (whoops). Also started pt on clinda 300 mg q6h ""until gone for dental infection, Refills x3; DAW!"".

Turns out dentist did root canal on wrong tooth and pt gets root canal on proper tooth w/clinda continued.

\----------------------------------------------

From what I understand, the dental students are each supposed to do a report on the different aspect of the case; i think my GF's doing the effects abx on the immunocompromised pt...which...honestly, i don't think i understand that prompt...

Anyway, i'm just curious about a unifying dx. Can't think of any type of bacterial infection that does both, so i'm assuming IBD of some sort (likely Crohn's). I also feel like a lot of medical professionals fucked up here, but what do i know? i'm just a lowly ER doc.

5usk1n,medicine,Let's say I wanted to approach the prep fo my internal medicine inpatient rotation by learning the 10 most common diseases/conditions as well as possible; what are they?,"My premise is this: I have a 4 months internal medicine inpatient rotation coming up (intern year). At my institution that means primary floor management with support when shit hits the fan. I do  not know before hand which inpatient services I will be with so in-depth preparation is out of the question. Instead, I would like to figure out an approximate list of the top x most common clinical scenarios; i.e. diseases, conditions and their management. I will learn this as well as possible which will free time to tackle specifics during the chaos of inpatient medicine. 

I'd like to hear meddits views on what that list should be. 

In my mind the criteria would be something on the lines of: 

* a) Common condition in inpatient medicine. 
* b) correct management is at least semi-acute. 
* c) does not normally require sub-specialty consults or interventions

Examples of what I was thinking of (+ suggestions so far)

1. Logical approach to chest pain
 - ACS / MI
1. Logical approach to SOB 
 - Decompensated heart failure
 - COPD exacerbation
 - Pneumonia
 - PE
1. Management of renal failure
 - AKI
 - ESRD / Dialysis
1. Logical approach to electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities 
1. Intravenous fluid do's and don'ts
1. Logical approach to inpatient fever
 - Pneumonia
 - UTI 
1. Making sure my patients survive sepsis
1. Logical approach to fluctuating cognition / neurological deficit
 - delerium
 - stroke
 - polypharmacy
1. Logical approach to: this [vital sign] is suddenly abnormal.
1. Logical approach to tachyarrythmias
 - New onset a. fib w/ or wo/ RVR
 - other SVTs
1. Management of DKA / HONK
1. GI bleeds
1. Gastroenteritis / colitis
 - C. difficile
 - IBD

EDIT: Adding as they come. Order does not imply rank. 

EDIT2: New approach: complaints rather than diseases/conditions when appropriate

1hdpuq6,medicine,Seeking Advice on EMTALA Violation Allegation: Surgeon‚Äôs Perspective ,"I am reaching out as a surgeon currently involved in an EMTALA-related case, and I am seeking guidance from those with experience in similar situations.

Many months ago, I was contacted by a stand-alone emergency department (ED) regarding a patient with a flare of hidradenitis suppurativa. The ED physician recommended transfer to a hospital where I was take call for wide debridement. I communicated that my understanding of acute flares are initially managed medically. Based on the clinical details provided, I suggested a medical management regimen‚Äîincluding topical antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and possibly biologics‚Äîshould be attempted first. I also communicated that surgical debridement is typically reserved for cases where medical management has been exhausted. At the time I was contacted, none of this was done.

During the conversation, I disclosed the limitations at my facility, including the lack of plastic surgery coverage, and stated that, in my judgment, the patient would benefit from being managed elsewhere for optimal care. However, I clarified that if no alternative placement could be found, I would accept the patient and provide care. At no point do I recall refusing to take on the patient.

This matter has now been escalated to the Department of Health. My leadership, including my boss and CMO, has informed me that a meeting will be held to address this case. I was informed that no fault maybe discovered, the hospital maybe fine and I also maybe fined. Since this was a stand alone ED, I do not have access to their EMR. Our transfer center does have the conversation recorded. However, I have not been provided with documentation, recordings, or any additional information about the complaint, which I find concerning.

I am seeking advice on the following:

1. **What to expect during this process?**
2. **How best to prepare for the meeting?**
3. **Should I consult with a healthcare attorney in advance?**

I understand EMTALA violations can carry significant consequences, including fines, and I want to ensure I handle this matter appropriately. Unfortunately, I lack mentorship or direct support in navigating this situation and would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations from this community.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1hdpuq6/seeking_advice_on_emtala_violation_allegation/,1734133882.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

6yn6aj,medicine,Why are there more clinical trials with faecal Microbiotatransplantation (FMT) on patients with Ulcerative colitis (UC) than Patients with Crohn¬¥s Disease (CD)?,"I need a little help and input!


I am doing research to prove or disprove **""Evidence of remission after faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease""** which is also my thesis¬¥ title which is basically a meta-analysis. 

I have selected 14 conducted studies (some were only abstracts from the ECCO conference) on that matter, each study being an evidence class 1 to 2b .


Now to my methodology part, I researched pubmed and well the ECCO database. Out of 14 studies, 13 were about FMT therapies on patients with ulcerative colitis, only one was with Crohn's patients. There were a few other case studies about FMT in Crohn¬¥s but the majority was for UC. 


Now I wonder and I am sure my profs will ask the same question on defence-day: Why are most trials conducted on FMT with UC patients and not Crohn¬¥s? I tried looking it up , of where the constraints of Crohn¬¥s with FMT could lie but did not really find anything with substance.



Any ideas?


I have searched the internet for answers but since it¬¥s such a new field, I couldn¬¥t find much of an answer... The only thing I could think of is that microbiotic enemas are applied through a nasoduodenal tube or rectally right into the colon and it can only take an affect in the gut. Which can (possibly) lead to remission in UC patients, since UC are only affected on the innermost lining of the colon.. And as of Crohn¬¥s which can affect different layers of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus which could lead to the conclusion that fecal enemas would : 1. be useless for any other part than the gut and 2. cannot pass through/penetrate the other affected layers of the gut.


P.s.: I checked out https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=ulcerative&term=fecal+transplantation&cntry1=&state1=&Search=Search and generally there are just more trials running for UC than CD.

2lksns,medicine,Differentiating NSAID gastritis from that caused by Crohn's,"On biopsy of the stomach, Crohn's *may* present with noncaseating granuloma, but it is neither sensitive nor specific for CD in the stomach (as opposed to in the bowels). Only a small percentage of those with CD have granuloma. Is this correct?

How, then, would one differentiate between NSAID-induced and CD-induced gastritis?

Example -- 
Colonoscopy: Pt has left-sided colitis with crypt abscesses and chronic, active inflammation on biopsy; also, cecal patch. TI is normal. Inflammation is suggestive of UC in its appearance but Pt experiences RLQ pain and other Sx that require CD to be ruled out.
Therefore, Pt had a capsule endoscopy.
Capsule endoscopy findings: Normal small bowel, erosive antritis -- superficial white based linear ulcerations with surrounding erythema in gastric antrum with scant hematin suggestive of erosive gastritis. Normal small bowel, no obvious backwash ileitis or inflammatory lesions in TI. 

H. pylori testing is negative and Pt denies NSAID use for the last three years except for a few times. 

To me, for a patient with established IBD, I would think Crohn's disease is most likely. Gastric CD is relatively rare, but if it quacks like a duck...
How likely might it be for the Pt to lie about not using NSAIDs? NSAID use is the most common cause, but if patient denies use, this can be ruled out. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2lksns/differentiating_nsaid_gastritis_from_that_caused/,1415367118.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vitals remained within normal limits and transport was uneventful, the pt/pt's mother informed us en route that she'd had an endoscopy a few days prior that discovered ulcerative colitis for which she had not yet started treatment, but she had been taking nexium regularly for related symptoms.  By time we got her registered and transferred to her bed in the ER she was completely stable in fowlers position on room air.

  I initially considered that her ALOC could be a manifestation of a postictal state and that the family had failed to recognize an absence seizure(/petit mal) while she had initially been complaining of abdominal pain before becoming lethargic, or something along those lines, but after seeing her vitals the significant hypotension pretty much rules out that possibility(right?). It seems like a pretty safe guess that the stomach/abdominal pain is due to the ulcerative colitis, but I haven't been able to find any research correlating even ""acute severe ulcerative colitis"" with ALOC or hypotension. She said she was positive that she had taken all of her medications according to her usual schedule and ate and drank normally all day, no new medications had been added in several weeks.

cusiat,medicine,Why are so many patients on benzodiazepines for long-term therapy to treat anxiety?,"I‚Äôve been practicing in family medicine for less than 5 years, one common thing that I‚Äôve struggled with is patients who come into the clinic taking a daily scheduled benzodiazepine to treat anxiety.  From my understanding benzodiazepines are not an appropriate or effective maintenance treatment for anxiety.  




Usually this patient has taken the medication longer than a year and it‚Äôll be a shorter acting medication taken 3-4 times a day.  These patients are generally not taking what I would consider a maintenance medication (SSRI, SNRI, etc.).  The most confusing part is that many of them feel like their current therapy is ineffective yet are not willing to try starting a maintenance medication, CBT, and weaning off of the benzo.





My problem with the situation is that I feel like most of the patients are truly addicted to the medications, treatment is not effective, and I‚Äôm essentially being forced into a role of helping them continue their addiction or a stop along the way until they find someone who will continue their prescription. 




Is there really a role for daily benzodiazepines?  Do you have patients who use this type of medication as their primary treatment for anxiety?  Outside of offering to start a new medication, start CBT, and tapering off of the benzo over several months is there a better way to approach this situation?  





I‚Äôm especially frustrated today as I had a patient file a formal complaint last week because I reportedly disrespected them by not understanding the severity of their anxiety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/cusiat/why_are_so_many_patients_on_benzodiazepines_for/,1566647774.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
16yhswm,medicine,Please help with a case of geriatric anxiety,"I have a problem with the patient. She's an elderly woman who became my patient last year after her previous PCP fired her. She's been fired by multiple PCPs in her area due to what I am about to describe. She's now driving 2.5 hrs to see me..

She's severely hypertensive. She is allergic to all anti-hypertensives that exist. In fact, she is allergic to pretty much every medication with an allergy list over 80 medications long, and she refuses to start new medications.

She constantly has symptoms. Chest pain, short of breath, can't sleep, stomach pain etc. They will last a week then something new. You name it. She calls the office every day and often uses the emergency nurse line and ends up taking up about 30 minutes of my nurse's day every day. To visit the ER multiple times a week. To the point where ED attendings are reaching out to complain to me. Her husband and her daughter are convinced that there is something wrong with her that nobody else can find it.

Between her multiple ER visits, she's had every amount of imaging known to man. Every blood test you can think of. Truly outside of her elevated BP, there are no objective findings of illness. She has been on benzodiazepines for over 30 years and recently changed psychiatric providers when her current ones started to taper her. I have got her in with geriatric psychiatry at my hospital, and they are also now weaning her Xanax. All of her symptomology is worsening during this Xanax wean and during this, no new anxiety medications because she refuses to start any of them.

I'm at a loss with her as she's tying up my clinics time my time and the ER's time substantially but I also cannot think of any more interventions to help her. I'm afraid I'm going to end up discharging her from the practice, but then I would just be doing what every other PCP has done for her. My clinic management is asking to start the discharge process. 

My current solutions are:

1. Do as my clinic manager asks and discharge her from the clinic, thus perpetuating the cycle

2. Have her stop seeing psychiatry, and myself take her back up on her xanax to a level that controlled her anxiety better. 

Previous solution attempts by myself:
- having an appointment every 2 weeks scheduled to talk about her symptoms

- I convinced her to start trazadone for sleep at one point which she developed side effects to and now cites this as a reason why she can never try any new psychiatric medication

- have geriatric medicine consult on her case( they had no suggestions other than to have receive geriatric psychiatry which has worsened the issue).

- having a discussion with her and the family about a more palliative approach. They are only interested in diagnostic approach at this time.

- setting boundaries on how many times she may call the clinic. (She has not been able to follow this)",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16yhswm/please_help_with_a_case_of_geriatric_anxiety/,1696305124.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

15hhliu,medicine,The Chen 2023 Paper Raises Serious Concerns About Pediatric Gender Medicine Outcomes,"When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.  
   
Viewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.  
   
During my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is ""normal"" in the broader population.  
   
I considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. ""How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?"" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.  
   
And I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras."" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.  
   
Regardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about ""Little Hans,"" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term ""penis envy"" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.  
   
Therefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say ""trans kids know who they are"" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.  
   
The waiting ended when I read the paper ""Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones"" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded ""GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning."" The authors report the outcomes as positive: ""appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased."" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say ""GAH was associated with improvements"" rather than ""GAH improved,"" but this is a secondary issue.  
   
The problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.  
   
315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing ""estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,"" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like ""My physical body represents my gender identity"" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.  
   
If a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (""Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults"") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.  
   
These numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like ""Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?"" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.  
   
I am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.  
   
Moving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: ""positive affect \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \[with an\] annual change on a 63-point scale \[of\] ‚àí1.27 points...and decreased \[anxiety scores\] annual change on a 100-point scale \[of\] ‚àí1.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment."" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).  
   
I won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.  
   
A more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.  
   
But my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.  
   
The 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.  
   
Of course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (""I like looking at my chest in the mirror"") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest"" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult"" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.  
   
Tordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported ""60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not."" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the ""no treatment"" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.  
   
The data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.  
   
We cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.  
   
The short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.  
   
I am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, ""affirmed"" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel ""fake"" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about ""being a man with breasts,"" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that ""there is something wrong with my body"" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.  
   
If we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we ""care about Alzheimer's patients"" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.

PS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (""born in the wrong body"") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.

These are lumped together so frequently that my brain just tunes it out. It is not because I don't care. I DO care but if I'm not careful my pattern-recognizing brain just ignores it as white noise. Does anyone else feel this way?

Edit: To add as FluviusNC helped me realize: the challenge is that the same PMH means something vastly different for each patient. For some, it's just old chart lore. For others, it's recent, and raw.

I think what I'm getting at is that these words/diagnoses are used so much that they have lost their meaning.

jirdiw,medicine,Case: 19y/o fighter with afib and liver hemorrhage,"Fighting is a very popular sport in my country, and even the local amatuer circuts get a lot of attention - big crowds, local TV station coverage, etc. These fights have their own private medical standby and low-acuity transport service staged on site. When we're staging, it's more for medical emergencies in the crowd or if there's a more severe injury to a fighter. Temperatures were 30¬∞C so heat illness was on the radar, but there was a drizzle. 

It's around 1¬Ω hours in and the private standby nurses call us to evaluate a fighter post-fight backstage. 19YOM with sudden onset panic attack, feeling of impending doom, dizziness, orthostatic near-syncope, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, palpatations, and shortness of breath. He was AOx4, GCS 15 - didn't sustain any strikes to the head but did sustain heavy strikes to the body, entire abdomen was bruised & rigid. He was hypotensive, pulse was 200+. 12 lead confirmed a-fib with rvr. He was tachypnec, blood glucose was normal, and capillary refill time was delayed at ~5 seconds. 

We decided to go for electrical cardioversion because the patient met unstable criteria, and we didn't heparinize due to the abdominal trauma & recent symptom onset. He weighed ~56kg so we administered 120mg of 1:1 ketofol (60mg ketamine 60mg propofol). We did a synchronized cardioversion at 100 joules. This successfully converted the patient to sinus tach. Prior to packaging for transport we did a FAST scan by ultrasound which showed Morison's Pouch (fluid in the hepatorenal fossa). Hypotension persisted and the patient began to have an altered mental status.  We packaged and transported to the trauma hospital, extending transport time by 15 minutes to bypass the community hospital. 

The patient came around from anesthesia mid-transport, we gave another smaller dose of 1:1 ketofol. Total transport time 25 minutes. Trauma surgical nurse & emergency doctor confirmed our ultrasound findings, started infusion of whole blood, and brought the patient directly to surgery for an emergent laparotomy.

Edit: Nursing staff did start one liter of lactated ringers prior to our arrival, which finished up just after cardioversion. We then hung another bag.

UPDATE: I've learned his surgery did go well. There was a fair bit of liver damage, but the amount of blood loss was not impressive - 880ml total. He did pop a positive urine drug screen for cocaine and unspecified amphetamines, which may explain the afib.

If something is possible but not really likely, at what point do you go with your gut instead of relying on statistics and science?","On my ER clinical last week I had a 26 y/o female who presented with severe tachycardia and tachypnea. Pt stated it felt like her chest and abdomen were being ripped open and were going to explode, and she kept repeating that she felt like she was going to die. This wasn‚Äôt some regular panic attack‚Ä¶ I could immediately tell she was experiencing impending doom. 

Pt was wheeled back to triage and vitals were obtained. HR was in the 170‚Äôs, with initial systolic of 198 in the R arm and 130 in the L arm. Her hands were cyanotic and ice cold so pulse was diminished which could have affected the BP.

 Per pt, she had long-standing episodes of significant tachycardia going on ‚âà 2 years. She had been having worsening neurological deficits in relation to HR increase for about 2 months, along with decreased perfusion to extremities. Pt was mildly disoriented and was having visual disturbances, decreased temp/sensation, and difficulty speaking. Prior to coming to ED, pt started experiencing SOB and the ripping pain; since both were new symptoms she came to ED. 

Pt put on monitor and was in SVT with hypertension noted. Modified vagals improved rate temporarily, pt was given a few liters of fluid which helped. Once the rate came down the ripping sensation lessened, but pt still complained of mild SOB and a ‚Äústrange warm feeling‚Äù in abdomen. Labs were drawn which showed some mild acidosis and a CXR was done, but no other imaging was obtained.

sed153,medicine,Best course of action for an unsatisfied patient who lands in your clinic after bouncing around the system for years?,"The other day, I spent 1.5hrs on my last patient of the day.

She came to me with a diagnosis of hyper POTS, severe anxiety with panic attacks, and undiagnosed spells after having seen multiple neurologists and a cards POTS clinic over a 7-year period. Upon arriving, she handed me several packets containing some (not all‚Ä¶) of the records from her prior workups. 

Long story short, it‚Äôs clear that (1) she has an exaggerated postural HR response, (2) these spells are not seizures, and (3) these episodes are not causing accumulated harm/disability. My clinical assessment (after reviewing the available data, taking a thorough history, and performing a complete neurologic examination) is that the spells are likely a physical manifestation of an underlying psychiatric process - possibly initiated by something identifiable like an exaggerated HR response, but ultimately non-neurologic in their full form.

So, I ultimately spent the majority of my time with her listening carefully to her story and thoroughly educating and providing reassurance as she brought up concern after concern. This is someone who has bounced around the system for years and still feels like she doesn‚Äôt have answers.

Typically, I keep the appointment to the allotted slot and force the patient to make a follow up for the next available. But there are cases like this where it is clear that the patient needs more, so this time I broke the mould to see what would happen.

Time will tell if it bears fruit or if my time and energy made no impact.

I take some ibuprofen and go back to bed. The pain recedes to a more manageable level. It helps if I keep my eye totally still. My mind retreats to fitful sleep.

1elpl5r,medicine,Absurd TNK case,"Reposted from /r/emergencymedicine

I wanted to share an absurd case of inappropiate TNK administration: Patient with history of cancer is sitting on a couch at home and begins to experience blurry and double vision and has a panic attack. They call EMS saying they are having a stroke and proceed to pack a suitcase (positive suitcase sign!) for hospital admission. 

Patient is transported to ED and has an NIH of 0, but has a complaint of double and blurry vision. Patient had a history of visual disturbances and blurry and double vision as a result of toxicity from chemo treatments and severe anxiety disorder. This is relayed during assessment in ED. 

CT head is negative, and Neurology states it is a stroke and to give TNK as visual changes are debilitating. Patient receives TNK and is admitted to ICU.

After admission, patient clearly has severe anxiety and psych issues. They state that they want to leave AMA, refuse neuro assessments, and remove all monitoring equipment. The patient agrees to receive treatment after resident orders Ativan and narcotics for back pain from disc degeneration. (Patient is prescribed narcotics at home)

A few hours later, patient comes to the realization that they just had a panic attack which aggravated preexisting visual disturbances. They then leave AMA just a few hours after receiving TNK.

Giving TNK was completely inappropriate. We have become so incensed to give TNK to patients with a low NIH just for metrics. It is wild how TNK is now given without a second thought. It seems TNK is being given far more often recently. I recently had a patient with an NIH of 1 receive TNK and develop a severe intracranial bleed. Patient is eventually declared dead by neurologic criteria and becomes an organ donor. 

The rate of inappropriate TNK admission is too high, and it seems to be becoming higher as a result of stroke coordinators trying to get their numbers up. Anyone else have an experience like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1elpl5r/absurd_tnk_case/,1722969644.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1faezaw,medicine,Can someone sanity-check my email to my clinic's APPs about stress testing for incidentally found ECG abnormalities in asymptomatic patients?,"Background: I gave a lecture yesterday on chest pain in the primary care clinic, and one of the PAs expressed frustration over finding incidental ECG abnormalities on screening ECGs. AT the time I gave a crap response, and wanted to follow it up with a better answer.  

Hey all,¬†

Jeanna had a good question/observation about incidental findings on ECG at the meeting, and I felt like I did not give a very satisfying answer,¬†so here's a follow-up.¬†

Here's my take on incidental ECG findings: ECGs are not good screening tests for asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, and neither are stress tests. That's why we don't recommend getting an ECG or stress test on annual physicals.¬† ¬†They are good for detecting coronary artery disease when an obstruction is present (obstructive CAD). So if you are using them as a screening test (e.g. obtaining an ECG for a pre-op exam or some reason other than chest pain or arrhythmia), try to further clarify the pretest probability of obstructive¬†CAD before sending the patient for a stress test.¬†

Here's what I mean: suppose you get an ECG for a pre-op exam, and the readout says ""Q waves in II, III and aVF - old infarct"".¬† Before reflexively sending the patient for a stress test, go back to the patient and ask if they are having or have had any symptoms concerning for angina or anginal-equivalent symptoms AND find out if they have risk factors for CAD (age, HLP, HTN, DM, etc).¬†

In the patient above, if they are a 45 yo runner with hypertension, they have a low pretest¬†probability for obstructive CAD (they only have 1 risk factor and they're giving themself a stress test every time they run).¬† This person does not need a stress test.

If that same 45 year old is sedentary and has DM, HTN, HLP, they have a higher pretest probability for CAD, but the pretest probability for OBSTRUCTIVE CAD is still pretty low.¬† I still wouldn't get a stress test, but an exercise¬†ECG (because it's cheap) isn't totally unreasonable to make yourself feel better.¬†¬†

If that sedentary, diabetic patient is 55, the probability of previously undetected obstructive CAD is higher still, but still low compared to someone with symptoms.¬† I probably still wouldn't stress them if the patient was truly asymptomatic, but you might be justified in getting an exercise ECG or MPS to¬†reassure yourself that¬†there is no current obstructive¬†CAD.¬†¬†

Raise¬†the age of¬†that same patient to 65 and give them knee OA so they can't walk, and the likelihood of undetected obstructive CAD is much higher (still low compared to a symptomatic patient).¬† I MIGHT consider stressing this person (because they can't stress themselves), but with the understanding that there is little evidence that stressing even a high risk patient like this does any good.¬† 

There's a meta-analysis from the BMJ in 2016 that looked at 3k diabetic patients that showed no impact on all cause death, cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI or a composite score, and that's even with 8% of these patients undergoing further angiography, 2.5% getting PCI, and 1.5% being sent for CABG.¬†

Keep in mind that this is all about ASYMPTOMATIC patients.¬† Please stress patients with symptoms concerning for obstructive CAD, especially if they have risk factors.¬†

I hauled like 4 patients from second floors to the ambulance in a surgical mask over an N95 or wearing my P100. I run half marathons but it was absolutely exhausting. And then, those patients get sent to triage. Triage. Why? Because half the ER rooms were respiratory isolation. Patients who need telemetry are sitting in hallway beds. I had to leave a woman having runs of V-tach in a hallway bed. I have never had to run a strip on a patient after getting them on the hospital bed *to document they had not coded before I left.* 

We had a double Level 1 Trauma from a pedestrian struck, and it was fucking chaos in the ER.  Two Trauma/ICU/surgical teams being pulled away from absolutely massive patient loads upstairs and nurses just having to deal with a patient actually masturbating in the hallway to then run to a double trauma made for tempers white hot with rage. I have never seen such apathy and disconnect from nursing staff before. 

I absolutely and totally live for the chaos of EMS. I have been doing it 22 years and to this day I love to rock out to complete shit shows and high stress calls. In the past, I could not wait for that shift of nonstop calls and a 12 hour high-dose natural epinephrine infusion. But when I see the patients I literally break my joints and back to take care of end up screwed and abandoned because some people just can't be sensible and civil, it fucking boils my blood. I mean to the point I am almost done. Like done. 

My point is all of these things on their own may not seem like a huge deal. But this time, collectively there seems to be less of a **nebulous** anger, desperation, and hopelessness, and to me it really seems *it is gaining focus at the system*, and toward those who just refuse to take small steps to care for themselves. 

When things are intensely focused, a fire is caused, and to me that fire is coming as Omicron is about to show us things that have never been seen.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXubd3QTHcw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXubd3QTHcw) (nearly identical, but video, shows the woman today, includes video of the incident)

Essentially, during May 2020, a nurse at an oncology infusion center collapsed.  Her coworkers *did* call 911, but they did not properly assess her, perform CPR, give her oxygen, retrieve the defibrillator.

Obviously the bit about starting CPR when they couldn't get a blood pressure is not correct, but they should have assessed for a pulse.

One nurse (her supervisor) filmed the whole event, instead of giving aid.  Doctors present did not help either.  One doctor said in trial that he ""was not qualified"" to give CPR.  When one of her friends she worked with showed up, that woman started CPR.

The nurse is now quadriplegic and need total care around the clock.

I think the workman's comp claim is a bit sketch too. Technically, heart attacks *can* fall under workman's comp in some situations, but this sounds like a sudden cardiac arrhythmia, and so it would be unlikely that workplace stress was a contributing factor I would think.

But ..... it's terrifying that she collapsed in a medical facility and no one followed basic BLS for 7 minutes until there was someone who arrived that insisted they do something.

The nurse recording the incident is disgusting, IMO.  I feel like that should be grounds for losing your nursing license, the gross indifference to someone dying in front of you is incompatible with being a nurse (or a doctor for that matter).  The fact that a doctor claimed he was not qualified to give CPR should at least have a license suspension.  If he's not qualified to give CPR, he shouldn't be qualified to give any sort of care.

Having a coworker collapse would be a nightmare to me, not just because it's a coworker, but because they're all adults.  But even in the NICU, we're required to be BLS certified and expected to perform CPR if needed on adults, morally and ethically, if not legally.

Are *you* prepared if one of your coworkers collapse?

Edited to add:  after reading some comments, if your hospital has ever directed you to not perform BLS on someone without a pulse for whatever justification, I would suggest you report that to your compliance hotline.  I do *not* think that directive would hold up under scrutiny.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1clehxs/nurse_has_sudden_cardiac_arrest_cpr_is_not_given/,1714986195.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

1hzrjsn,medicine,There's nothing more profitable to do with my license and training than pull more shifts in the ED. Why is that such a depressing fact? ,"Is this what they mean by golden handcuffs? (rhetorical question)

It really bums me out that even after all this training and restrictive licensing that the best use of my time is to grind out extra shifts in the emergency department.

There are relatively few alternatives that give me a better comparative return on my time. You'd think that someone with a relatively rare skillset and knowledge base would be able to better monetize those skills, but given the way the market works, no one is willing to pay cash for medical services. You have to play by the insurance rules.

Maybe that's the part that is so depressing. Knowing that my income will always be dependent on the whims of CMS and private third party payers, who want nothing more than to deny payment, defer payment, and make the entire process of getting paid the most onerous and costly possible.

I have a lot of ideas, but every time I do the math, the hourly rate is less than or barely equal to my hourly rate in the emergency department.

I just wish there was some alternative where I could use these supposedly valuable skills to make a living that wasn't reliant on a third party payer who is indifferent to patients and physicians. I think that's the part that really bums me out.

How are you guys holding up?

EDIT: I am getting a lot of replies about money. That is understandable, as I framed it primarily as a monetary concern. But it is more about being pigeonholed into a single role (staffing a hospital ED contract and begging for reimbursement from third-party payers). 

Maybe I just can't put the feeling into words and that's my fault. I don't want to be fabulously wealthy (well, that might be nice), but I would like to feel that there are other options for when the inflation overwhelms the reimbursements. 

It's the cognitive dissonance of learning a skill that people say is valuable and widely applicable conflicting with the reality that people don't actually value it as much as they claim to.

ymgplo,medicine,Treating depression feels like putting an band-aid on a bullet hole,"General outpatient pediatrician in the US who just graduated from residency a year ago, and I am really, really struggling with managing the insane load of depressed/anxious patients. Some of things I'm saying may be considered controversial, but I'm really just trying to find other ways to think about this so I can stay sane.

&#x200B;

It feels like at least half of the kids I see are being treated for depression and anxiety - and not just older teens (I have 9 year olds on SSRIs for depression with suicidal ideation). Lately, when I see patients come in with a new diagnosis of depression/anxiety, I can't help but wonder what it is exactly I'm doing when trying to treat this. In no way am I saying that depression meds don't work - they definitely do and it seems to help a lot of kids and adults. But when so many patients, possibly the majority of patients, meet the definition of depression, when does it stop being a disorder and start just being...normal?

&#x200B;

And I think that's the crux of the issue I'm struggling with. I have this nagging belief that contradicts my training - that the skyrocketing rates of depression we're seeing now is not pathological brain chemistry, but is in fact a completely normal reaction to the world we live in and the hopelessness of our future. When I prescribe medications, some part of me sees this as not treating a condition, but as enabling a fundamentally broken social system, providing a panacea so that people can continue to barely function in a world that is nearly unlivable. And as long as I keep prescribing, I am part of the problem. I am greasing the wheels to prolong the maintenance of a social structure that is fundamentally exploitative and unsustainable. I am wrapping up the bullet wound just enough and sending my kids right back out into that firestorm.

&#x200B;

Obviously, I'm not going to stop. I would never withhold treatment, and I don't want kids to die, which is what would happen if we stopped prescribing anti-depressants. But I think my ambivalence is showing when I talk to patients about managing depression. I feel insincere when I say there are things I can do to help, because all I'm doing is manipulating your body chemistry into thinking things are better than they actually are, and many of the fundamental problems that led to the depression in the first place are likely to actually worsen.

&#x200B;

Also, not to bury the lede, but I am also on high doses of multiple antidepressants that do not appear to be working anymore, so it's very likely that the terrible state of my own mental health is affecting how I practice. (Yes, I'm in counseling too. Maybe it will start helping at some point.) I don't know how to fix my own mental health, so I also feel like a fraud in addition to everything else. What business do I have trying to treat depression when my own is so poorly controlled by the exact management I am recommending for these kids, and when deep down I don't really believe what I'm telling them?

&#x200B;

Any different takes on the state of mental health? Anyone want to try to help me believe in what I'm doing again? No pressure or anything.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I left it out of the original post because I felt like it was too long, but for context, I am a rural pediatrician for a very low income population. I think about 40% of my kids experience food insecurity. These kids are also about 80% Medicaid. We have next to zero resources to help them and I am the primary mental health provider for the majority of my patients. I have spent hours calling local therapists, our local Medicaid CCO, tertiary care centers, teletherapy centers, etc. to try to find an emergency therapist multiple times, only to have to (for example - serious content warning ahead) tell the kid who was raped and brutalized by her attacker that she's SOL and all I can offer is recurrent appointments with me and Prozac. 

My point is, referring to DBT, CBT, and all those other great therapies with lots of evidence behind them is effectively not an option where I am. If anyone has ideas for where I can learn to do 15 minute interventions in my clinic that are kind of DBT or CBT-eque, that would also be VERY MUCH appreciated. I've just been the Marsha Linehan handout queen for the last six months, which feels...ineffective.

ymy3cr,medicine,Treating depression is the thing I love most in medicine,"I'm writing this in response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ymgplo/treating_depression_feels_like_putting_an_bandaid/). I must admit during parts of my training, particularly working with lower SES populations, I felt like the writer of that post. Our society sucks and life is cruel for a lot of people and a pill is not going to change that. However, my understanding of what depression is (and what is not depression) has been refined. I also must admit that at my most hopeless I was struggling from burnout and depression, and the hopelessness that is a core feature of depression was bleeding into my clinical thinking. As my mental state improved so did my optimism, and I'm glad the writer of that post acknowledged their MH was likely at play as well. 

I'm a psychiatrist working in a general clinic and a treatment resistant depression clinic. I chose this field because hearing someone describe coming out of a depressive episode is the best I have ever felt as a physician. Seeing someone smile more, describe feeling pleasure and enjoyment in the world, make tangible improvements in their life is why I do this. Treating depression is most of what I do. I understand the demoralization that can happen to providers working with this population. Working with physicians in other fields and spending time on forums like this, it seems a lot of misconceptions and myths about depression abound. A lot of people even question the utility of having MDD as a diagnosis since it seems everyone meets criteria. While a quick google search shows this is clearly not true (even the age groups with the highest rate of MDD is less than 20%), depression is something that is becoming rampant in healthcare settings. 

Major depression is a full-brain state, affecting higher level functions like mood, motivation, executive function, etc, but also affecting basic physiological processes like appetite, sleep, energy, even the speed of moving and talking. Sure, there are no lab tests for it, but there are well-validated fMRI neural network changes seen on fMRI that resolve as the depressive episode clears (we're just not doing fMRIs on everyone seeking a depression diagnosis). Untreated, the natural course of a depressive episode averaged at 6 months, and the brain is plastic, it learns to be depressed over time with longer and more severe episodes. 

I mention all this because so many healthcare providers seem to think depression is just due to capitalism, shitty-life syndrome, or whatever psycho, social, economic factor they are seeing at the time. ""Depression"" always has a simple cause and if that cause went away depression would cease to exist. I'll point out the rate of depression in Scandinavia is remarkably similar to the USA, and depression has existed at every time in history and under every economic system devised. A patient with shitty life syndrome may have a PHQ9 off the charts, but it is our job to distinguish the two and only treat depression in those who have real depression. People love to say depression wouldn't exist if we could prescribe $10,000 to everyone. I've treated millionaires so depressed they don't leave their bed for days, and if someone's ""depression"" lifted the second a check landed in their bank account it was not true MDD. Believe me, I would love to give 10K to everyone who needs it, but I would still go to work the next day and treat depression. 

To avoid the ""bandaid over a bullet hole"" feeling we should only initiate treatment once we are confident this is real MDD. Even if you have someone with terrible ""shitty life syndrome"" who also meets criteria for MDD, you can still help with their depression which will help them address their psychosocial factors. That may be years down the road and you may never see the fruits of your labor, but just be aware it happens. It is also essential to acknowledge that treatment of depression is multifactorial, takes time, and takes work on the part of the patient. Medications are maybe 20% of the picture when it comes to addressing depression, along with psychotherapy, good sleep, exercise, healthy diet, socialization... All of these things, including choosing to take a pill every day, take commitment and effort on the part of the patient. Your role as a physician is to provide one part of treatment and support them as able, but you are not responsible for the patient improving.

She says ""I 100% agree with you. He absolutely needs inpatient rehab, no question, he meets every criteria.""  
  
Great. As I get ready to move on with my day, she continues: ""Unfortunately, I'm just not empowered to approve him at this time.""  
  
Huh?  
  
I pause for several moments and ask, what do you mean? You just said he meets criteria and absolutely needs rehab. She states ""Like I said, I'm just not empowered to overturn this case. I highly suggest you place an expedited appeal, and I will be rooting for you that it gets overturned.""  
  
I was incredulous. I told her that he was a slam dunk rehab admission and reiterated the facts (as if that would help). I asked, how can you agree with me but not rule in his favor?

nvstjc,medicine,Controversy erupts over Aduhelm for Alzheimer's,"(this will be published tomorrow, but you get it here first)

For the first time in 20 years, the United States FDA has approved a new drug for Alzheimer's disease, news that brought both celebration and dismay. While patients and families suddenly glimpse hope, many researchers dismiss that hope as illusory. One FDA advisor, Prof. Caleb Alexander of Johns Hopkins, said he was ""surprised and disappointed"". Prof. Scott Emerson, a biostatistician on the panel, likened the drug‚Äôs development to ‚Äúfiring a shotgun at a barn and then painting a target around the bullet holes‚Äù.  Prof George Perry, a prominent neurobiologist, says this will ‚Äúset the research community back 10 to 20 years.‚Äù The stakes are high, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration is now evaluating Aduhelm for use in Australia.

Rarely do decisions by a small committee have such an impact. With over 150 million people projected to have dementia by 2050, new treatments are vital, and demand is ravenous. The company, Biogen, prices the drug at $A72,000 annually\*, and has no doubt that patients and governments will be willing to pay. In a hypothetical scenario where the 44 million current Alzheimer‚Äôs patients receive Aduhelm, that‚Äôs $3.7 trillion a year, or almost half of the world‚Äôs entire health budget. By 2050, it would be $12.6 trillion ‚Äì or $400,000 per second, every second. If Biogen receives the merest fraction of that, they have the quite the windfall indeed. 

Much of the real cost is also invisible to the company‚Äôs estimate. There is administration, which is by intravenous infusion every four weeks. Then of course come side effects, one of which was brain swelling in a whopping 40% of patients. Brain swelling is about as harmless as it sounds and needs regular MRI scans just to monitor. That burden alone would rapidly engulf the health budget of Midas at his peak. 

Such breathtaking expense demands compelling evidence. In a statement, Biogen declared that ‚Äúthere is finally a medicine that addresses a defining pathology of the disease, by reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain‚Äù. While acknowledging ""residual uncertainties"", the FDA said that ‚ÄúAduhelm is the first treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, the presence of amyloid beta plaques in the brain.‚Äù

The FDA statement reports the results of two phase 3 clinical trials: one showed ‚Äúreduction in clinical decline‚Äù, i.e. patients still declined, but slower than without treatment. The second did not, i.e. decline was just as rapid as without. What got Aduhelm over the line was this: ‚ÄúAduhelm consistently and very convincingly reduced the level of amyloid plaques in the brain in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. It is expected that the reduction in amyloid plaque will result in a reduction in clinical decline.‚Äù

Here we have a curious point. One of the two trials the FDA offers as evidence showed (1) reduction in amyloid, but not (2) reduction in clinical decline. The FDA then concluded that they expect (1) will lead to (2), which is precisely what did not happen. 

The FDA has drawn a line in the sand, and that line passes directly through amyloid (AŒ≤). So convinced is the FDA that they are willing to demote the clinical data (ambiguous at best) to secondary importance. In the favourable trial, Aduhelm patients showed 22% slower cognitive decline. That sounds impressive, but is falling from a building 22% slower any better? In real terms, the 22% derived from a difference of 0.39 on an 18-point score of cognitive and functional skills. There is little chance that 0.39 would be enough to escape placement in a nursing home, which is what prospective patients will be spending their children‚Äôs inheritance hoping to achieve. And so the lynchpin of Aduhelm‚Äôs approval is reducing AŒ≤. But how certain can we be that AŒ≤ is even the main villain? By the FDA‚Äôs own evidence, not very. 

A crucial lesson from medical school is the difference between association and causality. A classic example was a study that found a strong correlation between number of TV aerials and bowel cancer. Researchers feverishly concluded that radiation from the TV aerials was causing bowel cancer. Others scoffed and said that it was too much sitting on the couch. The truth was neither: TV aerials correlated with wealth, which correlated with eating processed foods. Here we can see that an outward mark of a process may have little or nothing to do with the process itself. 

I heard a psychiatrist once lament that current drugs were at the level of ‚Äútargeting bilirubin‚Äù. Bilirubin is the liver product that turns the skin and eyes yellow when elevated in hepatitis. A hypothetical drug against bilirubin might normalise the yellow colour but it would do nothing about the real problem, the hepatitis. Liver damage carries on unhindered. 

The question for Alzheimer‚Äôs is whether AŒ≤ is the bilirubin of the brain. Alas, much research suggests that it is. As discussed in *Alzheimer‚Äôs, the Arthritis of the Brain* and *Alzheimer‚Äôs Missing Link*, ‚Äúthe brain in Alzheimer‚Äôs is not merely crumbling with the march of time, but like a building engulfed by fire. The blaze is the brain‚Äôs own defences gone haywire; the plaques and tangles, the smouldering ruins.‚Äù Much evidence does suggest that AŒ≤ is more of a result than a cause. We may clear the ashes, but the fire burns on. 

We can also be certain that much of Alzheimer‚Äôs can be blamed on amyloid‚Äôs partner in crime, the tau protein. The ApoEe4 gene is another culprit, but far from the only one. The real enemy may be further back in the shadows, and all we can see now are shadows of shadows. Researchers can be sure that AŒ≤ is at least part of the process, and some evidence suggests that it fuels the fire once begun, at least in some patients. We might therefore tweak our housefire image to say that AŒ≤ is like the embers. Removing it will not douse the flames or repair the damage, but it might slow it down in some cases. 

One unfortunate aspect of Aduhelm is that these findings about the lesser role of AŒ≤ date back well before the drug was even developed. Researchers should have known that any benefit would be marginal at best. Biogen probably understood that they were barking up the wrong tree, but with so much money at stake, why not bark a little louder?

In a longitudinal cohort study by Oomens et al. 2025, including 324 individuals from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer‚Äôs Prevention, the lifestyle for brain health (LIBRA) index comprising 12 modifiable risk and protective factors was not associated with trajectory of the main cognitive composite (PACC-3), or longitudinal changes in tau burden, white matter hyperintensity, global brain atrophy, and hippocampal volume. Some caveats here include the fact that the population is enriched for genetic risk as 39% are ApoE4 carriers, which might limit the impact of lifestyle differences. Also, given that this is a preclinical cohort it could take more time for effects to emerge. I also wonder about the decision to control for imaging biomarker z scores in their models: if such measures are mediators on the causal pathway between LIBRA and the cognitive composite, wouldn't including them as covariates tend to hide LIBRA effects? In fact the authors note that ""in sensitivity analyses, we found a LIBRA\*amyloid status\*age interaction for PACC-3 z-scores if the model was not adjusted for biomarkers (visualized in Figure S5)"".

As you are aware, current therapies for Alzheimer's disease have at best only a modest effect on the rate of progression (amyloid beta mAbs), and at worst only address the symptoms of the disease (eg AchE inhibitors, NMDA antagonists). As such, when counseling patients who are cognitively intact but express fear of developing dementia at some point in the future, we often tailor our response with attention to known risk factors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, etc. We advise people to optimize their risk by staying physically active and so on. But does this make a difference, or are we only making the patient (and ourselves) feel better about our lack of control?

jkbvsz,medicine,CONFESSION TIME: I‚Äôm a Neurologist and I don‚Äôt like people," 

Many of the people here are doctors, so I hope I can start with a sympathetic ear, before I get bashed for being in medicine. 

\---

It‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm an introvert. You‚Äôll always be my patient. I took an Oath. I will always care for you (unless I fire you from my office for cursing at my staff, but even then I‚Äôll refill your Keppra until you find a new doctor)

One of my stroke patients is the president of the local Old-Town. Don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs doing well. I enjoyed explaining to him the value of slowing down for a couple months to protect his health, but also moving forward so he doesn‚Äôt succumb to memory loss. (He made it easy for me, he‚Äôs an educated white male). Other people have deeply deeply seeded misconceptions about health care. Not something you can break in 2-3 visits. I‚Äôm just happy they actually came to see a doctor.

I‚Äôm less than 5 years post-training. I opened my practice 3 years ago. I have a partner whom I trust, and along with other docs, we work on avg 1 in 4 weekends. My clinic weekdays are from 8:30-3:00, sometimes packing it 8-4. I regularly stay til 5-6 to tie up loose ends. I Take a half day on Wed and Fri to tie up the rest of the loose ends. I‚Äôm on stroke call on avg 1 in 6 days, but it will run 3 consecutive days for the weekend. The other guys cover the pager when I‚Äôm not on for the group.

* I shouldn‚Äôt complain.

Obviously I‚Äôve always known my job is about being with people. And I love people. But individual interactions are more draining. For example, I just spent 15 minutes understanding why someone refuses to take blood pressure meds.  I would rather have spent that time getting to know them on something they actually enjoy talking about, but that‚Äôs not what I signed up for. I could have been a restaurant owner, I guess. 

In order to keep my office open, I have to see at least 15 patients a day. On my hospital rounding days, I see 15-40. Above 30 and that‚Äôs when I get REALLY tired. I may snap at a nurse. Or I may stop showing interest once my patient gets to their third or fourth complaint. 

* Oh, side note, I hate it when people save their pre-written list of complaints for the END of the encounter. Fucking open with it. If I don‚Äôt know the concerns, I can‚Äôt properly address them in the short time. 

I mean, we all have hard jobs. I would never say I have it harder than any one of you. We are in this together, as they say (and I believe).

It‚Äôs interesting talking to people, if only I had the time. Nobody can truly open up in 10 minutes We need a solid 30-45 minutes, but ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that! Ooh, here‚Äôs a fun case! How to convince a Fibromyalgia patient that they are not actually deteriorating in health. They are harming themselves more by not exercising. Their hypochondria always beats me. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll order you one more test. But please, get out and exercise.‚Äù BTW, the worst hypochondriacs in the US, are definitely the low-educated health care workers, like CNAs or MAs, and less in LVNs.). They just need a little extra attention, mostly because of how hard they try with the limited understanding that they have. 

Medicine, in my book, is about maximizing someone‚Äôs life‚Ä¶ quality vs quantity, the ever-lasting debate. I won‚Äôt go into the money factor right now, or how much risk vs benefit a 1 in 30 test is gonna be...

How long do you keep your 89 year old father alive for? That I could write about a lot!

Perhaps my favorite story is when I see the look in the 78 year old grandmother‚Äôs eyes as she proudly tells me about her successful grandkids. 

So at the end of it all, I still don‚Äôt like people.

yvh38w,medicine,Chief Complaint: Exposure to Toxic Mold,"Let's say you have a patient coming in to your clinic with that chief complaint.

Obviously if the patient is symptomatic, I would work up their symptoms.

But if the patient is asymptomatic, how would you approach the situation?

&#x200B;

EDIT: They had symptoms. She requested blood tests that I thought were inappropriate, so I told them we'd just start with a CBC and IgE, and I referred them to an allergist. Also wrote a letter saying their symptoms are due to environmental exposure at home, so maybe they can be accommodated. I guess I've just been jaded by so many asymptomatic chief complaints, I was expecting the worst, but this was mildly interesting.

EDIT 2: So this turned out to be quite a bit more complicated than originally thought due to the lack of good scientific evidence on mold exposure.

On the one hand you have anecdotal stories from people like /u/Irishhobbit6 where the story fits a correlation - patient is at home and has symptoms, and symptoms resolve when they leave home; must be environmental exposure to mold, right!?

On the other hand you have the [position statement](https://www.acmt.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PS_060101_Institute-of-Medicine-Report-on-Damp-Indoor-Spaces-and-Health.pdf) posted by /u/wandering_meatloaf where the American College of Medical Toxicology says that while damp indoor spaces pose a health risk to humans through allergic mechanisms, it's highly unlikely that this is due to mold exposure.

But then if you dig deeper, you learn that there are phenomena like [sick building syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_building_syndrome) that are associated with a [Stachybotrys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachybotrys_chartarum) that is also known as ""toxic black mold.""

But if you keep digging, you'll see that the [CDC's position](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/faqs.htm) is that Stachybotrys and other molds have not been shown to be linked with neurological issues like lethargy and memory loss.

So I think doing something like basic blood tests to help alleviate the patient's anxiety and then trying to have them sleep somewhere away from the exposure may be the reasonable course of action. I'm open to other suggestions though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/yvh38w/chief_complaint_exposure_to_toxic_mold/,1668470751.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

1lu2bg0,OCD,"Visiting my fianc√©‚Äôs family, with contamination OCD: a confession","I do like my fianc√©‚Äôs family a lot, and they are always very welcoming when I come to visit from far away. However they run their household very differently from how I run mine and how I grew up. I have contamination OCD, and I have IBD- a combination that makes me very hyper aware of food safety!! I am very aware of safe food temperatures and storage and expiration dates and everything involving food safety and storage, because to me I see it as life or death essentially. However, when I go to visit them, I am faced with my worst nightmare: their food habits. They leave cooked rice out open on the stove for days, room temperature, they will cook it all for dinner one night, then turn off the heat and leave it on the stove until the next time they eat it until it‚Äôs all gone. Constantly reheating and reusing said rice and letting it sit out. They will leave cooked meat on the stove or the counter (in soups or with rice or something) again, uncovered, unrefrigerated. Store bought eggs that were in the fridge, will be stored in cabinets. Foods with dairy products like cheese will be left out for days. And they continue to eat it all no problem! Granted, they don‚Äôt get sick all the time, but fianc√© does get bad digestive episodes occasionally. I am always gracious when they offer me food, but all I can think of is the bacteria growth. I politely decline and sometimes even eat things in secret (like going out to get something) or I will just eat crackers or raw fruit/ vegetables for meals. Sometimes I even skips meals and say I‚Äôm not hungry and just go to bed. I feel so rude, but with my whole being I can‚Äôt overcome the thoughts. 

Also important to note- I have always been very aware of food safety precautions, but it really increased to the severity it is today after I got Campylobacter after staying at their house and eating their food for a week. It left me with long-term problems and now a highly sensitive mentality- so now I think it‚Äôs just a triggering environment for me where I notice everything now. 

I‚Äôd also like to emphasize- I am never rude about it! I am always polite and respectful and I would never criticize how they run things. It‚Äôs just very different from how I do things, but no one is right or wrong here, just different family cultures and perspectives which we all can appreciate! They are very lovely people, I just needed to get that off my chest to people who may relate!

14ciqu2,OCD,How you cope with association OCD?,"Hi there, I got a question.

First things first, I'm starting Fevarin (fluvoxamine) now, but the dose is small in the beginning, so I think it doesnt reach any therapeutic effect yet. Tried Anafranil, but couldnt stand the side effects.

I have a problem with association OCD, intrusive and burning thoughts. For example, I can't completely finish building my new PC, because every day my brain generates random word which, I think, will associate with the PC if I finish it (have to reinstall Windows and add few parts). Sometimes the word I get is connected with my iRL activity (for example, I have a doctor visit tomorrow, so my current intrusive thought is 'intestine' as it's my IBD doctor), and sometimes the word is absolutely abstract, like coming to my mind with no reason and staying there. Thing is, the thought changes each day so I can't find a day where my mind is clear and not burning. That's why my PC parts are lying down since 3 months. I want to finish it, but I can't. It's just a specific example, but the association goes with any single, little decision I made in life.

Other thing is, for example, I can't create the character in online game cause every name reminds me of anything and just this association stops me from any action. Yet, I'm unhappy cause I can't play.

These thoughts are most often bad thoughts, connected with rather unpleasant things, but not always. Sometimes they are just random.

How do you cope with such thoughts? Is there way to try to solve it or maybe I should break the spell, ignore these thoughts and just try to enjoy my new PC? I still remember my previous thoughts connected to other things - like PC microphone, mouse, other things - they are there when I think of it, but they are not burning me anymore as they used to.

uwipqn,OCD,My teenage daughter lives her life sitting on the toilet seat,"&#x200B;

Until recently I had a happy, healthy charming 15-year old (now-16 year old) high-school daughter. She was into making crafts and doing karate classes.

Starting in Autumn of last year she started complaining of occasional stomach pains and indigestion. At first we all disregarded these pains but they seemed to become more frequent and more intense. So we took her to the pediatrician.

Since then our daughter tells us that the pain and symptoms have gotten progressively worse. We have had innumerable tests run on her: blood, urine, pancreatic function, endoscopy, all of which consistently show complete normal results. The doctors can't find any physical problem. Their best hypothesis is that somehow all the nervous signals between her brain and her gut have gotten themselves into a scrambled state producing a form of IBS. And the way to remedy this is through hypnotherapy treatment ([https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/digestive-health/gut-directed-hypnotherapy-ibs-ibd-gerd](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/digestive-health/gut-directed-hypnotherapy-ibs-ibd-gerd)). We have been trying that for a few weeks and there is no progress yet. 

However, there is something much much more worrisome simultaneously going on. She started spending longer and longer in the bathroom. At first it was maybe 30 minutes at a time, but it started stretching into the hours. Because of this, she stopped attending school in about February. She just sits there for hours on end on the toilet. And she cleans her backside obsessively. If we try to urge her to come out, she gets angry, sullen and we hear her gagging/wretching in response.

It has now reached such a point that she spends 24 hours a day sitting on the toilet. My wife takes her food in there. She watches Youtube videos in there. She sleeps sitting on the toilet. And she refuses to come out. She is becoming increasing sickly. She has lost probably about 10% of her body weight. And there seems to be no hope in sight. She does not interact with any humans (other than when my wife brings food to her). She does not have any exercise. She doesn't live a functional life.

I have been trying to get her admitted to Sheppard-Pratt mental facility in Baltimore ([https://www.sheppardpratt.org/](https://www.sheppardpratt.org/)) that I have heard treats extreme OCDs. But both my wife and my daughter have been trying their best to resist this due to social stigma they have about mental illness.

Has anyone out there, maybe a doctor ever witnessed this kind of behavior? What can we do about it? I'm shocked, scared and confused how to deal with this situation and I think if it is not corrected, it could lead to something much worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/uwipqn/my_teenage_daughter_lives_her_life_sitting_on_the/,1653366843.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
tyd2um,OCD,"Derealisation and nearly fainted at the gym, could this be something more serious?","Ok, so I've recently started at the gym properly again after a 4 month break due to a severe IBD flare up and weight loss. Today I attempted to do my first proper workout in months.

When I arrived at the gym I was anxious and derealised because of my obsessive and paranoid thoughts which happen often. However I first started noticing a popping in my left ear, and then extreme light-headedness causing me to almost pass out, and I couldn't continue for fear of passing out. I feel like the passing out was correlated to my thoughts and anxiety as it happened when I was thinking OCD thoughts.

Anyway I left the gym and I'm now sitting in my car waiting to feel a bit better to make sure I'm safe to drive.

1h7tk8l,OCD,My Biggest OCD Trigger is Farting and it‚Äôs Ruining my Relationship,"I feel ridiculous for even typing this out. I‚Äôve tried to open up about this in other places or to other people and they more or less tell me I‚Äôm being ridiculous or overdramatic or that I just need to grow up. But I can‚Äôt control it and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I cannot STAND farting. I can‚Äôt. It makes me gag and/or sometimes vomit if I so much as hear it. Even typing out the word as I am here is making me wince. I know many people have an issue with it to some degree, but if it happens in the same room as me I legitimately cannot think of anything else for a few minutes. My brain just screams at me that the air is contaminated and that the smell is going to seep into my pores and it is so gross and disgusting to me. And please do not tell me I am being ridiculous‚Äî I know this. I know it‚Äôs a problem with me and not anyone else. But it‚Äôs starting to ruin my life.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now, and I love him so much and I fully intend on marrying him. However, there‚Äôs one problem‚Äî he farts a LOT and I genuinely cannot handle it. I‚Äôve tried to shrug off how much it bothers me because he is so nonchalant about it but I will genuinely think about it the rest of the night if he does it in front of me. I know everyone does it and it‚Äôs not a big deal but to me it makes me view him so differently and as if he‚Äôs ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù (and I KNOW he‚Äôs not actually so please don‚Äôt give me a hard time) and I genuinely have no idea why. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not I can smell it, or even whether or not I am in the room with him at this point. Even if he does it over the phone I will have to focus really really hard not to gag. I can‚Äôt help it.

My first boyfriend knew about my issue with it and would go out of his way to crop dust me and ‚Äúdutch oven‚Äù me and I genuinely think that‚Äôs the main reason we didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm horrified that I‚Äôm undateable because I know it‚Äôs not reasonable for my current bf to refrain from doing it in front of me ever again.

Please, I don‚Äôt know how posting this here could possibly help me but I am out of options. I feel as though this aversion is driving me out of my mind.

1dnyu2k,OCD,My ocd and how it has grown,"I am a 32-year-old man and I remember when in 2011-2012 I was driving a car.  So at the end of the night I always had to drive a certain way before going home.  It's the first observation of my ocd.  Then symmetry neuroticism also came.  I mean, if the keyboard on the desk wasn't aligned with the screen, I always fixed it.

Well, later I started to watch my eating and I wanted to start exercising a lot.  I went to the gym and ran.  Back then, there was no fear of hygiene when it came to your own hands, but there was with food.  Because in 2016-2017 I started having strange stomach pains and strange bowel sensations.

2018-2022 I had challenges with my intestines and eating.  I started to observe in the store, for example, the protection of the chicken package (is it broken?) And did I get diarrhea from it?  Why did I have diarrhea 2-4 times today?  Why did I have to go poop in the evening?

but in 2022 I got a diagnosis of Crohn's disease and a diagnosis of anxiety.  Now 2023-2024 my ocd has grown big and I have struggled with it a lot.  Ocd is related to numbers, washing hands a lot.  Symmetry and obsessions. And fear to poop many time in day.

and I have to do certain things at a certain time during the day.  For example, I have to pee at 14:10 and not 14:25.  I also listen to certain songs in the morning.  Yeah I know this is weird..",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1dnyu2k/my_ocd_and_how_it_has_grown/,1719294892.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

&#x200B;

I finally told my doctor today about being assessed for OCD. I told her my symptoms which are Perfectionism, All or Nothing thinking, Intrusive Thoughts (mainly sexual ones that involve family members and kids...!), fear of germs, excessive hand washing..!!

&#x200B;

When I had to explain the sexual intrusive thoughts about kids, it made me so uncomfortable and the way the doctor came over has made me feel like crap! I can tell she wasn't completely educated on OCD. I mean its not what she specialises in as she's a General Practitioner.

&#x200B;

I also told her about PTSD as I believe that's what triggered the OCD for me but she dismissed the PTSD and said I think its best we work on the OCD first! She told me she would talk to another doctor who specialises in mental health and will get back to me next week!

&#x200B;

I've experienced a lot of trauma in life and its only recently that I've learnt how much its actually affected me! I've repressed a lot of it for many years including repressing anger! I've experienced emotional abuse since I was a kid, I spent a lot of my childhood in hospital with Crohns Disease, feeling like the Crohns would kill me off before reaching adulthood, years of bullying, manipulated into sending nude pics that ended up being shared around my high school and sexually assaulted at 15! I dropped out of mainstream high school at 15 and I haven't been back in education since! I just can't get myself back into that kind of setting after everything I went through in school! I rarely leave the house and if I do, its always with someone. I definitely struggle with Avoidance and I also can't deal with conflict! I want to get better! I've seen many counsellors, psychologists, therapists over the years but I just haven't had much luck.

&#x200B;

The counsellor I see currently is private as all the others have been on the NHS but it hasn't helped because of the limited amount of sessions especially considering I'm a complex person with many issues! My current counsellor is extremely nice and I knew her from my childhood and she's helped me recognise a lot of these struggles which is why I'm seeking help for it though I've been seeking help for other things for many years!

pn1eoi,OCD,my experience with Ritalin (prescribed for ADD) while having OCD,"...has been really good so far.

I was previously prescribed Bupropion 300mg w/ Prozac 60mg, which helped... a little. I was intensely dependent on my bupropion to do as little as get up in the morning or make it through the day-- I have serious issues with fatigue, partially from depression and partially from having an autoimmune disease. Fatigue from one of those always tends to make the other worse, too-- it's like they feed off each other.

Anyway, I relied on bupropion but was also hyper aware of how bad it was for my OCD. It'd make me /super/ anxious. Since I also have crohns, it also made my already-abysmal appetite even worse, and caused me to under-sleep rather than over. Additionally, I still struggled with my yet-to-be-diagnosed ADD.

I gotta stress that I relied on Bupropion to function, like, it was a necessary evil. I was really stressed abt getting off of it and watching my life pass me by as I became more exhausted (even if less anxious). Having bad OCD from it was just what I accepted and was honestly really shitty but somehow preferable. 

I was taken off bupropion & put on Ritalin which I expected to be really bad for my OCD (but since it's a stimulant would still be a reasonable substitute for Bupropion irt to fatigue and depression, and would finally help with my untreated ADD symptoms too).

Much to my shock, it's helped my OCD just as much as my Prozac has. Hell, when I'm on it, I can literally feel it working for /both/. Like, I'm just less distracted by everything so there's less opportunities for stupid intrusive thoughts to come up. It lets me literally nip my cycling thoughts in the bud, which is AMAZING. 

A good example of this is when I was trying to figure out what mug to drink my coffee out of that morning. Choosing a mug can be stressful, i.e.: ""if you choose this one, you will study better. If you choose this one, you'll get a headache, but you'll have a more fun day. If you choose this one, you might--"" and etc. If I try to fight those thoughts  and say ""shut up OCD, I'm going to choose what I want"", I then get stressed out about which mug is the ""least OCD choice"". Which is like... such a classic.

Anyway, on Ritalin, I found myself JUST ABOUT to go down that rabbithole, and it's like I interrupted my own anxiety and was like ""wtf fuck you I like blue"" and that was that. Like, it literally ended there, and I didn't think about it again. I didn't /try/ not to be OCD I just wasn't, and a new ability to be decisive has allowed me to stop considering every Goddamn absurd avenue. It's really awesome.

I was expecting it to make me hyper-focus and spend all my time on my compulsions but it's done the opposite by quieting the obsessions themselves, like it's just helped me focus on what I *want* to be focusing on. Hell, my OCD & ADD are like evil twins, so maybe it makes sense that one would egg the other on so bad. Disorders are intersectional after all-- like, having multiple means they interact w/ each other and the result can be really different from just \[x\]+\[y\]=\[xy\]. I'm not really sure what's more at play, if my ADD being treated means by OCD is also losing some of its footing, or if Ritalin literally does help OCD, or if Ritalin literally helps OCD when one also has ADD/ADHD. Who knows. I hesitate to recommend it because of just how infamously bad stimulants + anxiety disorders tend to be.

 Anyone else have similar experiences? It was such a shocking and pleasant outcome that I just had to share, haha. I feel really, really hopeful for once.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/pn1eoi/my_experience_with_ritalin_prescribed_for_add/,1631481620.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
lfonuv,OCD,OCD and a chronic illness,"I feel really bad. 

I have a chronic illness (crohn‚Äôs disease, EDS, and dysautonomia). I was diagnosed with crohn‚Äôs disease when I was 15 and get bi-monthly infusions of a drug called remicade to keep it in remission. I‚Äôve missed out on so much of my life because of pain and weakness even with the treatments. 

OCD has made me obsessed with the possibility that I‚Äôm faking or exaggerating my illness‚Äî that I want to be sick, that if I talk about it then I‚Äôm trying to get attention. It sucks. On my healthy days I spend the entire time convinced I was never sick to begin with, that I‚Äôm ruining my own life, etc. And then on the days that ARE rough, I feel relieved because I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh! Thank goodness I‚Äôm not just faking it!‚Äù (insert immediate regret here because pain sucks, no matter the reassurance). 

Anyway, I was looking for solidarity or just a community in general for people with chronic illnesses, and I accidentally stumbled upon a reddit community entirely dedicated to ‚Äúouting‚Äù people with chronic illnesses as being attention seekers/liars/in denial. It had 55,000 members. 

A lot of the posts are screen caps from other people talking about their illnesses‚Äî things I heavily relate to and that are familiar to me. And the comments are all just... Picking these people apart and making intense claims about things that are ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù about what they‚Äôve shared about their illnesses. (Examples of ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù behavior to them is like, saying you had a bad experience with a doctor, posting about IV treatments, being sick one day and able to do fun things the next) which are like, things I deal with, aha... 

I just can‚Äôt get it out of my head. It makes me hate myself so much. I spent like an hour going through the posts trying to find proof that I am or am not one of these ‚Äúfakers‚Äù that they‚Äôre complaining about. 

It was just so triggering. Why are people like this? I feel so ashamed, and knowing that 55k people are all laughing at exactly the thing I obsess over the possibility of being is like a punch in the gut.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/lfonuv/ocd_and_a_chronic_illness/,1612826046.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
oz5ev8,OCD,Health OCD/Anxiety,"Hey everyone first post here I am a bit curious if anyone else can relate to this and maybe give me some advice. Once every few months maybe every other month I‚Äôll have something that is only a slight pain or a bodily function that is maybe a little messed up for whatever reason and I‚Äôll completely blow it out of proportion. I‚Äôm sorry if that was confusing here‚Äôs some examples of what i mean.

Last fall I had a slight soreness/pain on the left side of my torso near the bottom of the ribs. It was there for about 2 day and wasn‚Äôt getting any better so as any sane person would do I looked up what it could be on the internet and thought I could have mono or leukemia. Thankfully it would turn out to be either of those and go away in the next 2 days but i have had this sort of thing happen maybe a dozen times in my life and some of them are pretty wacky. There was a week when I my bowel movements were all Out of wack so I thought I had Crohn‚Äôs disease. I‚Äôve thought I‚Äôve had testicular cancer, a broken femur after I just crashed my bicycle, a hernia, a broken arm, I‚Äôve thought one day I‚Äôm just gonna up and develop a deadly allergy to nuts/almonds, rhuemitoid arthritis or a pediatric version of Multiple sclerosis, a broken collarbone, and one night where I woke up at 4:30 am and tried figuring out why I woke up and then I focused on the fact that I couldn‚Äôt breathe deeply and had shortness of breathe and thought i may die which could have potentially just been a panic attack. Oh I also thought I  had breast cancer once even though I am a guy?? I am an extremely healthy person (20 M), and go to the gym almost every day and stay away from unhealthy foods as best I can. I do all this overthinking which causes me to freak out and kill any good mood i have because I think I may have a chronic or life changing disease. Let me also clarify I dont have any genetic family diseases except I will probably get Alzheimer‚Äôs later on (75+) just based on family history. Deep down I know that all of this is in my head but the thought of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù drives me crazy. It also can be quite embarrassing to think about going to a doctor because they are gonna look at me and just be like come on man. 

I have know a lot of people with chronic illness in my life, cancer, autoimmune diseases, MS, and so on, however these are all people who are significantly older than me (30 years+). I looked up what this could be and stuff about health anxiety seemed to come up. It‚Äôs not a daily or monthly consistent thing but it is still something that I‚Äôd like to get rid of.

15getwl,OCD,I don't know if I should seek help or not...,"*TL;DR:* I can't decide whether or not I should seek help for OCD-like issues. I don't know if it's serious enough.

Ever since I got a quite serious inflammatory bowel decease called ulcerative colitis around 6 years ago, I've had issues with contamination worries. I avoid touching things that I (sometimes rather arbitrarily) think are contaminated and wash my hands excessively. As a result, my hands look horrible and regularly bleed during winter. I generally avoid doing things that involve having to use a public bathroom and tend to avoid trips and travelling for that reason.  
I also have an very har time eating or drinking anything that might have gone bad.  
I don't fear getting ill, but somehow the feeling of disgust itself is the issue.

For a few years, my parents have regularly commented on these behaviours and asked me to talk to a professional about it. But I'm just not sure if the issues are serious enough to warrant diagnosis or treatment. Every time I start considering possibly getting help, I get conviced that it's not bad enough and that I'm being ridiculous for even contemplating it.  
I read people's descriptions of their OCD, and when some of them have way more severe symtoms than me, it just seems to show, that my issues cannot possibly be *real* OCD.  
I don't want to talk to a doctor just to be dismissed.

I keep zig-zagging between thinking that I might need help and trying to erase the thought from mind. I had exactly the same thought-spiral when I've had periods resembling depressive episodes. And right before getting diagnosed with ADHD.

Halfway through writing it, this post seems stupid and unnecessary.

It got worse when I lived through thyroid cancer last year) I started using Luvox (50mg) last week and I got a terrible case of diarrhea and it does not stop. I googled and that did not go well (I fear it is Celiac, Ulcerative Colitis, even cancer). 
Before Luvox, mi digestive system was fine. Has anybody had this issue? How long does it take to go away?

rrc4ru,OCD,Convinced I'm being persecuted or my reality is cursed,"I've been ruminating for 7 years about strange things happening, but I never truly faced those fears until now.

When I was 14, my computer typed how are you on its own. Ever since then strange things have been happening with my computer and outside. I had an online girlfriend who got strange messages regarding intimate things we talked about. Files on my computer went into the recycling bin. Then 2 years later I had a training appointment at the gym and it got cancelled, and I assumed someone was listening from my computer.

But the thing is now I'm convinced my mind is being read rather than my computer being hacked solely. When the laptop said how are you, it was when I went away for a few seconds and came back. The laptop has no camera, so I'm scared someone read my mind and knew I was away. Then when my gym appointment got cancelled, how would a hacker be there at the exact right moment to listen, unless someone is reading my mind?

Other strange things have happened and my mind has been racing piecing things together. When I was in school people would touch me when I wasn't looking, but they wouldn't do it to anyone else. My doctor referral letter got lost when I seeked mental help. I also developed tinnitus and ulcerative colitis, and found strange fibers in my bodily fluids which is apparently something called morgellons, and I didn't believe it at first until I made absolutely sure they were coming from my body. 

Once I even found my computer DNS code had changed, and I wrote down the code, but that piece of paper disappeared strangely despite taking care of it. I once found a strange substance on my phone that looked like semen when I went downstairs to get my phone in the morning. 

I've just been piecing together all the strange things and it's overwhelming. They started off as obsessions but I'm believing them now. These occurrences are so weird after all.

I don't know what to believe anymore. They sound so crazy but what's been happening to me truly is crazy, and I've been reading accounts from people going through worse things than me. They get called delusional and schizophrenic but it's way more than everyday paranoia, as in there are people getting their tyres slashed, their cats killed, strangers walking by saying one syllable of each insult. People having things in their homes messed with like their chairs being sawn in half. While some of them might be mentally ill, there's no way all of them are.

Now I'm having a mental health crisis. I'm convinced my life is being controlled, and my mind is being controlled and read, and that maybe reality itself is being controlled. I do have OCD, and I have been ruminating over these things for years, but I don't know what to believe anymore, can these things be true even if my OCD is obsessing over them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/rrc4ru/convinced_im_being_persecuted_or_my_reality_is/,1640795468.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

I've had severe anxiety since I was a little girl, I am now 26 y/o female. 
I am unemployed and have been now for several years. I have panic attacks and about every anxiety symptom you could think of. 

I've realized lately, though, that I have many ocds traits. As I write this I had to move my shoulder in a way that I write ""cursive"" in the air. So I wrote down traits, I physically moved my shoulder to spell it in the air, I hope this makes sense. I've done this for so long.

I'm also sitting here having irrational thoughts, I drive myself so insane that I'm rocking back and fourth trying to convince myself the things I'm thinking are not true, because I know they are not but my brain convinces me they are true. 

Is there anyone on here that can relate to me? I feel like I'm gonna go insane. I do realize I only listed like 2 ocd traits, I do have more, I will just post this for now to see if anyone knows what I'm talking about.

Thanks in advance, hope everyone is doing okay.

He became paranoid Friday night when a group of young adults that were near us starting laughing and talking..he thought they were making fun of him.

I have symptoms of contamination OCD ‚Äî not really a fear of getting sick, but I feel a deep urge to keep certain things decontaminated, while not caring as much about the contamination status of other items.

I also have recurring urges to touch/rub/scratch/bite very specific points on the right side of my body, sometimes to the point where they scab, bleed, or get calloused. This started happening right after I developed social anxiety (my most severe and pervasive mental health issue).

I feel like my brain has created these symptoms as a form of stress relief, making me feel like I‚Äôm more in control of my environment or body.

1lzc8y4,OCD,Wasted my summer due to OCD & depression. Can I still turn things around?,"Hey everyone,
I'm a 21-year-old engineering student (BTech, 3rd year), and I really need to talk to someone ‚Äî or just feel heard by people who've been through similar stuff.

This summer, I had around 80 days off, and I had planned to learn Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Web Dev, and start preparing for internships. But instead, I ended up feeling completely stuck.

I've been on medication (Fluoxetine + Aripiprazole) for OCD and depression, and the side effects in the first few weeks were tough ‚Äî fatigue, emotional numbness, restlessness, and just... mental fog. Despite knowing that, now that only 1 week is left in my vacation, I'm filled with shame, regret, and fear that I‚Äôve completely wasted these months.

Some of my friends have already started solving DSA, doing projects, getting internship-ready ‚Äî and I feel like I‚Äôve fallen so far behind. And then I read these scary posts online like ""If you start DSA in 3rd year, it's already too late"" ‚Äî and it just crushed me.

What‚Äôs worse is that I'm scared once college resumes, I‚Äôll get caught up in dramatics club work (I'm a director), academic load, and will again not get time to study. This same cycle happened last semester too, and it‚Äôs exhausting.

I know deep down that I wasn't just lazy ‚Äî I‚Äôve been fighting something real. But now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve ruined my chances. I‚Äôm also struggling with focus. I know techniques ‚Äî Pomodoro, blocking apps, Notion, all that ‚Äî but I just can‚Äôt seem to start or stay consistent.

I guess I want to ask:

1. Has anyone else been through this and come out okay?

2. Can you still catch up in 3rd year and get internships, even if you‚Äôre starting now?

3. How do you actually get back your motivation when you feel like you‚Äôve already messed up everything?

4. How do you deal with the guilt of feeling ‚Äúbehind‚Äù your friends?

Please be honest. But please also be kind. I‚Äôm not looking for sugarcoating ‚Äî just real stories or advice from people who‚Äôve felt this heaviness and found a way through it.

I started out by trying a lot of supplements for anxiety (my mom is really into natural stuff). After that I went on ssris. citalopram, zoloft. That was through a primary care doctor. Then I went to a psychiatrist. I tried a few more ssris. I tried clomipramine. I tried glutamate modulators. I tried an antipsychotic along with an ssri. I went through ketamine treatment along side therapy. I have gone to an outpatient ERP program. They couldn't treat my severe anxiety and sent me to a DBT program which turned out to be the worst therapy experience of my life. I have been to countless therapists and psychiatrists. I have tried kratom, cbd, kanna, NAC, St Johns wort. Any ""natural"" supplement you can name I have tried. I have done trauma and somatic therapy. Brainspotting, yoga, interoception, mindfulness, body scanning, deep breathing, meditation. I've even done multiple psychedelics. My psychiatrist (who I have gone to for years) prescribed me clonazepam. Not even the benzo did anything for my anxiety.

I have heavily abused alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, DXM, Ketamine. Anything to quiet the anxiety. But it has destroyed my health.

To be clear the mental illness was present before abusing these substances. That is why I turned to these substances.

I have been looking into things like Stellate Ganglion Block, TMS (this doesn't seem promising for a number of reasons), vagus nerve stimulation.

I only have medicaid.

1m65pm0,OCD,Any tips for not worrying when it comes to health ocd and hyper awareness ocd,"So i would say hyper awareness is the root cause of most of my ocd themes. Mostly to do with bodily feelings and sensations but im also hyper aware of things in my environment and noise. 

Ive been having brain fog really bad since the beginning of this year. Can honestly say i started having memory issues as of the end of last year. But the longer time goes on the worse it seems to be getting. Ive always been hyper aware and vigilant of my thoughts and consciousness and how my brain functions and processes things and ive just seen that tank since the beginning of this year. From forgetting all kinds of things, to forgetting words way to often which has also been affecting my speech. My ability to focus on most things is Shakey right now because im overly aware of my thoughts not functioning how they used to. And i even see problems in my reading and writing capabilities. 

My parents keep blowing it off as either just my meds or my ocd and anxiety or both, but ive had ocd and anxiety and depression for years at this point and while ive had brain fog in the past ive never had it day upon day and causing the kind of memory issues im experiencing now. And its gotten so bad that its been causing me a lot of worry and anxiety i would normally not have, and unfortunately because of this since the beginning of the year my health anxiety has come back which isnt helping things. So ive got all kinds of worries now that i have a brain tumor or abcesses, or i worry i have an early onset of either dementia or Alzheimer's as all that stuff tends to run in my family on my moms side. And honestly the latter 2 terrify me more than anything, even though rationally i know even if i do have any of those things worrying about it doesnt solve anything. 

Anyway its got so bad as of late im even having a hard time recalling past memories and i really notice that and it bothers me when someone starts talking about this thing or that thing that they experienced in the past because when i try to recall something from my past i simply cant and thats mostly due to the fact that my photographic memory sucks now and i have to really strain and try to get that to even work slightly. Its really annoying and frustrating to deal with.

I called my doctors office today because this feeling that i dont even know myself any more and cant ever think straight is really bothering me, and theres just no way at this point i can keep blowing it off and just assuming my parents are right and that perhaps it is my meds or mental health issues at play. Because im 34 now and ive had mental health issues since my teens and never had memory issues to this extent.

Anyway just curious if anyones got tips for people who have hyperawareness as a theme and health anxiety as a theme to be able to calm my anxiety and wory over whatevers going on? I mean its really funny because im the kind of person who, i can go to the doctors and if they diagnosed me with one or more of the things im afraid i have it might bother me initially but once i got home from a doctors visit and had an answer i wouldnt care any more and just do what i need to.

sorry for the long winded post but im just exhausted from all this and would like to learn some tricks to combating at least the parts of my issues that cause me anxiety. I havent been able to sleep much because of these things lately and thats playing into it too. OCD and anxiety is a pain sometimes.

1lwsf4a,OCD,"My partner said she thinks my appetite loss is due to OCD and a need for control due to my OCD, my therapist said it's worry and depression...?","So I (23F) have a past of mental health issues, including depression, mixed eating disorders, PTSD, obviously OCD and have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. (Sorry for the long post)

The last 1 and a half weeks I've gone from eating my usual (usually 2 small meals and a few snacks a day) to having 2 homemade smoothies (partly due to appetite loss and partly due to my ADHD deciding everything was too much effort, or so I thought when I decided to try smoothies) and a small meal, to now barely even being able to have a smoothie and part of a meal. Everything has started to taste bad, my brain tells me ""you should probably eat"" because I know I haven't eaten enough and I make a smoothie, or try and eat something and I'm having to force myself to eat/drink any of it. Yesterday I had about 800kcal, and I'm supposed to have atleast 1400kcal (that's if I'm trying to lose weight).

Recently I've had a lot of stress in the house with my partner and kids which is just starting to calm down, stress with my family outside of home like finding out a family member has Alzheimer's and trying to locate where they are because no one seems to know. I have also gained some weight in the last year after I quit smoking, but I don't think my appetite loss is due too eating disorders as I don't have any of the same feelings, and I've accepted that yes I have gained weight but I think it's partly to do with me quiting smoking which is better for me and partly because I often eat sugary things to make me feel better (an ADHD trait of mine) which I think will get better once I start a medication for ADHD.

On top of all that I had to have my last session with my amazing psychologist a few days ago because I'd gone over the maximum amount of appointments I could have (which is 20, I had 28 appointments, in the UK) psychologist said before I left he thought my appetite loss and struggling so much with eating might be because I'm worried about how I'm going to be without therapy, he didn't want to discharge me, didn't feel I was ready for it and we had more progress to make but he didn't have a choice... 

Tonight my partner was hungry when we were planning to go to sleep so we went downstairs for a midnight snack, I was looking around the house to find something I could stumoch that wasn't a lot of effort to make and ended up making a smoothie, managed to drink half of it by force but it tasted awful, even though I made the exact same one a few days ago and it tasted great! My partner noticed my frustration and said she thinks it to do with my OCD because of everything that is going on... I don't even know if OCD can cause appetite loss or this kind of thing... 

Does anyone here have experience with this issue?

1j1gbff,OCD,Does anyone else struggle with memory?,"To make a long life story short, I‚Äôve always known I had a really poor memory and that it was because I have a fruit salad of mental illnesses (GAD, MDD, OCD). But I never really understood why until I googled it today to learn more. 

‚ÄúPeople with mental illnesses, particularly depression and anxiety, often experience memory problems because the stress and emotional turmoil associated with these conditions can negatively impact the brain regions responsible for memory formation and retrieval, like the hippocampus, leading to difficulties in encoding new information and recalling past events; this can manifest as impaired short-term memory, difficulty remembering positive experiences, and a tendency to focus on negative memories.‚Äù

What spurred this was my aunt telling me about a time about 13 years ago when I was 19 and she was sick and in the hospital with food poisoning. Apparently I went to go see her and brought her flowers. She even remembered that they were daisies. I remembered none of this when she brought it up. It‚Äôs like it never really happened.

Not only does this make me really sad that I potentially have positive memories from the past that I just DON‚ÄôT remember now, but it worries me about what I‚Äôll forget in the future. I have a 2-year-old son and going through this realization about the memory with my aunt makes me sad to think that, one day, my memories of him as a baby and toddler may just be‚Ä¶ gone. üòû

Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else has a hard time with this too. Feeling really down about it right now. üòû

17vysbb,OCD,You can take your life back from OCD and here‚Äôs how I did it.,"I am a person who had a healthy childhood and both parents in the household until I was 12 years old. My parents divorcing did not affect me at all as I remember. Apart from some trauma I had endured when I was 14, everything was normal.

One December when I was 15 I was up at night restless and could not get myself to sleep, at the time I had been having some trouble focusing in school and my primary physician decided to prescribe me 25 mg of Adderall. The Adderall of course caused me to have trouble with my sleeping due to the fact that it‚Äôs a stimulant meant to keep you sharp and awake for daily activities. 

I made my way to the kitchen to get myself something to eat as my brother was also grabbing food from the pantry. Beside him were our set of kitchen knives that my family has had for years. 

All of a sudden my brain just pictured a bloody scene involving me and my brother. Just the thought made me squirm and of course I didn‚Äôt pay any mind to it. Right after, I chuckled to myself and said ""why are humans like this, the brain tricks itself‚Äù. As went back to my room, my curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to know if this was a common human experience‚Ä¶ intrusive thoughts? I didn‚Äôt know what it was, and I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely normal for everyone on this world. 


 What happened to me that night made me wish for the next 4 years that I had just gone to sleep and avoided all the pain that I endured. 

I grabbed my computer and started searching what it could be, and a certain phrase in my computer made my life stagnant for a long time.

""Suffers are afraid they might act on these intrusive thoughts‚Äù

It had never occurred to me that we have free will and even though we might all have these strange thoughts‚Ä¶ if the body wanted you to act on it, it could be done. 

The fear and the panic took over my body and I spent my night crying in my room. When the sun had gone up my mother found me in a pile of my own tears and we drove straight to the psychiatric unit of the nearest children‚Äôs hospital. 

I spent seven days in there, wishing it could all be over. I saw more than a dozen psychiatrists and therapists who tried to get me to talk while I just stared into the abyss. 

I said nothing to anyone in a very long time. My life after that was nothing but loud, my thoughts were incessant every second of the day and the only way I was ever at peace was when I closed my eyes to sleep at night. 

My obsessions over the course of 4 years ranged from fear of schizophrenia, fear of losing my mind, fear of being a serial killer, fear of being a racist, fear of Alzheimer‚Äôs, fear of cancer. 

Paralyzing fear.

I did 3 years of therapy and did not receive the correct diagnosis due to my lack of truth, I refused to let anyone inside my mind for the fear of being perceived as a monster.  I knew I wasn‚Äôt a monster, I was a kid. But my mind convinced me otherwise.  I remember I used to cry every single night in my bathroom, I used to wail and just pray that if there was a God, that I needed him to save me. That I needed him to release me from what I was feeling and I‚Äôd devote my LIFE to him. 

And no, this isn‚Äôt a testimony, I didn‚Äôt get saved. I got through those 4 years struggling to breathe. I saved myself. After so much struggle, I found little by little ways in which I could help myself, I started teaching myself exposure therapies that actually quite helped. The last day this disorder had a hold of my life I was 18, I remember I had an intrusive thought just like any other. And after the help I had given myself I knew that me paying attention to the thought and trying to convince my own brain that I wasn‚Äôt a killer, would make it worst.


Every single thought I had, I let it go. 
I learned that OCD is a monster that needs to be fueled and the more you try to convince yourself and reassure the thought, the bigger and stronger that monster inside of you gets. 

OCD is a monster that needs to be deprived and I KNOW that it‚Äôs hard resisting a compulsion, I know that it makes you feel like you want to run towards the end of the world and keep running until you fall off the earth. But do it.

It‚Äôs been 5 years since I last struggled with OCD and sometimes I forget that I used to pray for moments like these, in which I‚Äôm calm and my own mind is not my enemy. I forget that I used to live a life in which I did not want to live. Of course some thoughts do pop into my head sometimes but I let it go, the most valuable piece of information that I gained was that we all have these irrational thoughts, the only difference is that OCD sufferers give the thought MEANING rather than just letting pass by. 

We are all humans and I promise you that you aren‚Äôt alone in this fight, whether you take medication or not, go to therapy or not, you are strong and you are capable. I believe in you, if anyone ever needs any type of support my messages are open and ID be SO willing to help or lend a hand!

And i stumbled across a question on qoura where there was a person who wrote stuff like ""forget about the voices there is gang violence in America"" so i went on thier profile as a form of ""ERP"" but it only made things so worse
They wrote stuff like ""let the voices do you"", ""how can the voices be in my head if i hear them from a distance?"" 
And that literally triggerd me so bad and my 'OCD' got so bad because of thier post to the point i was convinced im going crazy because i read thier post
So i got over reading and the anxiety it bought me but now im starting to get anxious because of another thing
You know when you like remmeber a song and it plays in your head? Yup like that, it happens to me but with like memories or 'voices' and its makes me so anxious like what if im going crazy?

this year I have unintentionally hyperfocused in prion diseases and I try so hard to not think about it. since my grandma is staying in my home due to a surgery in her elbow, I have to help taking care of her. this would be no problem if it weren't for my ocd. but yesterday I researched again on Alzheimer's and I've found discussions whether it can be caused by prions and if it can pass to one person to another and I've been on a rabbit hole of reading and thinking and panicking.

1l46l2i,OCD,My OCD is making me believe i have an early onset of dementia,"Honestly wouldnt be surprised if i do have it and quite frankly wouldnt care that much if i were to receive such a diagnosis. But as of this year my memory has gotten way worse than its ever been, ive also been having symptoms of a certain sleep disorder in which is a huge sign of having dementia.

And its all playing into my health ocd where lately ive been googling my symptoms, which i know i shouldnt do and i will say ive been good in noticing when i go to google my symptoms and then talk myself out of doing it. But still ive caught myself doing this again after almost 8 years of not doing it because of this intense fear of having dementia.

and rationally i dont understand why im having this fear. Because i know if i do have it A theres nothing i can really do about it and B i wouldnt be this scared if i was diagnosed with it. 

This reminds me of the years i swore up and down i had various forms of cancer to find out i didnt. And i really dont want to wind up wasting my mid 30's like i did with my mid 20s doing this. Even if i do have an early onset of dementia id rather just do what i can to live the best quality possible of life i can and would do positive things regarding it. 

I am going to the doctors about all the things ive noticed about myself since the beginning of the year. so i guess ill find out one way or another. I just hate that my ocd loves to waste my time like this and in other various ways. Its really a bunch of BS and it gets exhausting.

I have had obsessive thoughts surrounding death my entire life. I lost my biological mother at a very young age, so I refer to my step-mother as my mother. I have feared the death of my father and mother for so long. It‚Äôs the theme of many nightmares, for months at a time. I have other behaviors that lead me to believe I have OCD. This isn‚Äôt really about whether or not I have it, it‚Äôs moreso about this specific fear. I know that dementia is a slow process, but watching her deteriorate before my eyes and becoming a shell of her former self is killing me. It‚Äôs consumed my every waking thought.

1ha28hb,OCD,"Started Zoloft, feeling much less physical anxiety, but I feel this fear / obsession of slipping out of awareness / consciousness / dementia","I think I am finally getting over the worst of my most recent obsession with getting schizophrenia or psychosis. I‚Äôve convinced myself to believe my therapist, doctor, and partner when they tell me I‚Äôm not showing signs of psychosis at all and that it‚Äôs just anxiety. Convincing yourself is an amazing feeling once it happens.

The only bummer is that the obsession has mutated into a more abstract fear that what I hear and see either won‚Äôt be real, or that my thoughts won‚Äôt be my own or under my control, or that I will be lost and confused by what I‚Äôm experiencing or thinking. It almost feels like a fear of being in a dream state. This falls in line pretty well with the DPDR symptoms I‚Äôve been dealing with for 8 months now, but it feels scary and a bit stranger on the Zoloft.

Since being on SSRI‚Äôs for the first time months ago, I have had increased intensity of hypnagogic audio ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù, and just more loud and scrambled pre-sleep thoughts. They can keep me awake sometimes, but more specifically now I am struggling with waking up in the middle of the night half-asleep with part of my brain running wild in nonsense free-association world, and the other part feeling that and freaking out. I can sometimes only recall faint moments throughout the night of having essentially a strong panic response, and a mental sensation that I am NOT okay, that I‚Äôm not safe and I am slipping away.

This sensation echoes the fear I am currently obsessing over in my waking hours as well. I feel hyper-vigilant of my senses, particularly my hearing. I am anticipating hearing something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. I am second guessing things I hear, checking that they actually happened outside of my head. My thoughts feel loud and almost unexpected when they pop in. I imagine conversations as they are unfolding and it‚Äôs distracting playing out the imaginary version while the real one is happening, especially when I‚Äôm hyper aware of those thoughts themselves and they almost startle me.

I would love to hear some acknowledgement that these are just anxiety / Zoloft / OCD experiences. I feel like if I let my guard down I will slip away and lose myself, but hearing reassurance helps me let that guard down and realize I‚Äôm okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ha28hb/started_zoloft_feeling_much_less_physical_anxiety/,1733720495.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1bacpd5,OCD,Please help Me get through this: fear of dementia  (TW),"Hello.

I have a horrible fear of dementia, I am undiagnosed but I have repetitive, repetitive thoughts every single day for a year about dementia.

It started because of dpdr. The unfamiliar feelings that comes with derealization gave birth to this fear. Which started because of a panic attack on February 8th, 2023. Which was caused by health anxiety. I thought I had a tumor because of headaches. I got a CAT scan on my brain in the er and there was nothing. A month prior of that panic attack I had a panic attack while smoking weed.

Just now I was trying to sleep and the dementia thoughts arose, and now I am in a horrible anxiety dementia loop

Nothing is helping, the scary thoughts are winning

It is like this

What if I started believing my family is dead, and when I see them later I won't recognize them. (It is 2 am). Isn't that something someone with dementia would experience. I'm so scared. Why would I even think that if I didn't have dementia. I'm paralyzed by fear, the thoughts set off every two seconds. It's not even like ""what if"", the thoughts keep saying mu family is dead and I won't recognize them later. Is it because my fear of dementia? Or is it because I have dementia? Please help me. Please. Do I have it or not? I'm saying their names over and over and over, I know their names, I know their faces, but the thoughts are just ""DEAD"". Please make it stop. I know they're alive but what if I start believing they are dead like someone with dementia would? What if I don't recognize them later. The fact that I'm even questioning. QUESTIONING if they are dead.  

I keep recalling a video on tiktok of a woman with dementia, not recognizing her daughter, sayingshe didn't have a daughter. Scrolling through her daughters page and seeing her moyher fine just a year earlier. Please what if I'm in the early stages. I need to see a doctor bad I'm so afraid.

1axs5zn,PTSD,Gummy Worms," 
TW: Illness, near death experience, sepsis, Crohn‚Äôs 

I need to vent. TLDR: I associate candy with my near death experience and I‚Äôm frustrated 


Back in 2020, I had a near-death experience. Long story short, I felt crummy for a long while (not abnormal for me to feel sick), I ignored my symptoms for years, then eventually got sicker and was hospitalized for six days at the height of the freaking pandemic. I was admitted with septic shock, blood clots, spots on my lungs, and a sudden 25 lb weight loss. I didn‚Äôt have ten pounds to lose, let alone 25. I‚Äôve since been diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs. Things are a little bit better now, but I‚Äôm still sick with a few other things. That‚Äôs not what this long post is about; this is about Trolli gummy worms and my PTSD. 

In July of 2020, I was hospitalized and  watched a ton of cable tv in my room. Cable tv is dead, if you didn‚Äôt already know. It‚Äôs all marathons of ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù and other mostly garbage. I mostly watched movies on IFC, four different Adam Sandler movies on a loop with ‚ÄúThe 40 Year Old Virgin‚Äù in the middle somewhere. You never realize exactly how much cussing is in ‚ÄúThe 40 Year Old Virgin‚Äù until you watch the bleeped-out cable version in hospital gown while a whole group of people are checking your naked everything for more blood clots, and et cetera.

In between the movies, I kept seeing the same commercial for Trolli gummy worms. It was the one where a bunch of high-pitched singing gummy worms crawl inside of the body ofa large, dark, and horrifying looking tree creature. I was out of it and thought the commercial was a fever dream or something. Adam Sandler was my sleep paralysis demon that week (and for a long while after), so I think it was fair to not trust my own eyes. 

Here I am, four and a half years later, and I still cannot stand to be near Trolli gummy worms. Every time I stand in the checkout line at the grocery store or wherever, seeing the packaging on those freaking gummy worms makes my heart rate shoot up and I feel uneasy or in danger. Today, I was with my mom and sister at 7/11 to grab drinks on our way back to my apartment. I was having a good time, not paying attention, and I almost came close enough to touch a small wall display of Trolling gummy worms. I immediately started to panic and got away as fast as I could. My mom asked what was wrong, but I feel so silly for being afraid of candy. She‚Äôs not helpful with this sort of thing; she just tries to logic my issues to death and then gets upset when I ask her to stop. 

It‚Äôs hard to not feel frustrated with myself. It‚Äôs just candy. The commercial isn‚Äôt all that scary. I‚Äôve tried to watch it since the hospital out of curiosity and while I didn‚Äôt have a good reaction to it, I know that it is just a silly advertisement. I‚Äôm mad that almost half a decade has passed and I‚Äôm still struggling with this. I‚Äôm in therapy but I have bigger fish to fry in my sessions than focus on this particular part of my mental health. I don‚Äôt know if I need to make myself buy a package and eat them (I don‚Äôt even like sour candy), or if I need to learn to ‚Äúbe friends with my anxiety‚Äù the way I‚Äôm supposed to be doing with my OCD. Compared to my other trauma, this one feels the most ridiculous. I don‚Äôt know how to talk about this with anyone around me because it feels so small when I say it out loud. I keep seeing these damn gummy worms everywhere I go and I just want one thing to be easier in my life, even if it‚Äôs just standing in line at Kroger or getting snacks at 7/11.

The way my body screamed I was dying, the acceptance of death, the way my surgery scar re-opened before me, but it was only the beginning. 2016: Respiratory Failure due to MERSA in my port and wakeing up months later. 2019: Extreme weight loss due to Crohn's that left me at only 55lbs. 2020: losing a close friend and having to identify him. 

Request/Question:
I have these dreams that last for hours where I can feel pain, taste blood, hear the sounds around me, it not only comes for me but those I hold dear and hurts them too. And when I wake up it's so hard to tell what's real and what's not. I see a doctor regularly for these things but I have no support group aside from my husband and my friends don't understand at all what I mean and I feel like I sound crazy when I talk about it! Is there anyone who struggles with this? How do I fix it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/11hn75r/support_group_desperately_neededrealistic/,1677897832.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10cw1gg,PTSD,PTSD impacting my career,"I was diagnosed with PTSD as a teenager years after a childhood diagnosis of Crohn‚Äôs Disease that left me with an ostomy bag by the time I was 12. As a teenager I had extreme and severe depression and was hospitalized repeatedly for depression/suicide attempts, but I‚Äôm almost 40 now and overall have been okay. I recently was, long story short, kind of forced into a new role at work that I absolutely despise. I desperately want to quit asap but I really need health insurance, which I carry for myself and my kiddo. Quitting would also force my fiance into a breadwinner role (we would lose my $80k+/year income) and he is also now wanting to get married quicker than we planned so he can put us on his insurance. I am obviously dealing with a lot of guilt and repetitive negative thoughts about myself being a burden or a failure. I‚Äôm also having panic attacks for the first time in 4 years. The one thing that helped was edibles, which I can no longer take since I need to look for a new job. SSRIs never worked for me in the past but I‚Äôm not current on new treatments.

ti42r0,PTSD,Trying to support my partner while he's triggering me,"My boyfriend has really bad health anxiety and has been dealing with stomach issues for the last two weeks. He went to the ER and they found no blockage and his GP thinks it's probably just IBS-C, but he's been seriously freaking out even since the relatively minor diagnosis. For the last two weeks just about all of our conversations have been about his stomach issues and his anxiety about them and his anxiety attacks have just been getting worse and worse and worse. The more he thinks about his health, the more worked up and anxious he gets.

I was diagnosed with PTSD after a 5 and a half year long abusive relationship. My ex had Crohn's, and every time he had a flare, and especially when he had flares that required trips to the doctor, his aggression and violence towards me would skyrocket. He took all of his frustration and anxiety over his health out on me. Eventually my reaction to any prolonged talk about his health became trying to shift the topic to ANYTHING else to try to de-escalate before things got bad.

For the first week of my current boyfriend's health issues I was able to manage the fact that the subject was triggering and was supporting him fine. But as the issue goes on my own anxiety and fear keep building and its turning me into a terrible partner. I want to support him, but I'm terrified of being in any proximity to him. And I feel like I can't talk to him about how triggering all this has been for me because I don't want to make him ashamed of needing support from me. I don't want him to feel bad for leaning on me.

He got upset with me today because I shifted the topic to one of the good things going on in my life and it sent me into a bit of a spiral. He felt invalidated and like I didn't care about the fact that he's been having health issues, and that's entirely fair. He deserves support. But it also made me feel even more triggered because I feel like I'm playing the game of walking on eggshells again. For two weeks everything has been about his health and I just wanted to talk about something I was excited about and maybe take his mind off of things. His perfectly reasonable upset just felt like I made a bad step in de-escalation and am going to pay the price for it. And it feels like I'm not allowed to be excited about things while he's anxious and that sort of thing was exactly the type of stuff my ex would do.

I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just haven't had any place to really talk about the fact that this is all stressing me out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ti42r0/trying_to_support_my_partner_while_hes_triggering/,1647721742.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
illi2u,PTSD,I‚Äôve got the hamsters all running on debating wheels and I can‚Äôt come out with the right decision! Why is making decisions for myself so hard?! Explanation below...,"I‚Äôm a 36f, single mother of a 21y old daughter and an 11y old son.
I was semi raised by a narc mom, and eventually both of my parents abandoned me at separate times in my life. Nmom moves 3000kms away and left me to fend for myself at 16 with a 1y old.

I have experienced every type of abuse that exists. Unfortunately. And somewhere along the lines I started thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok, I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm not falling apart‚Äù lol, boy did that bit me in the chops!!!

So I‚Äôm in therapy, was finally ex with adhd, anxiety, true insomnia and ptsd. We‚Äôll just add that to my crohns, RA, reynauds and several other physical health diagnosis‚Äôs. Screw it. My body hates me.

Anyway. I‚Äôve always been stubborn, hard headed as they say, and fiercely independent (sometimes to my detriment). I refuse handouts (not that I was ever truly offered them). But, whenever I‚Äôve asked for help, it comes with twenty strings attached and a whole pile of threats and manipulations (TW) ‚ÄúI bought you x, so you must not do y for me‚Äù, I pay to keep this roof over your head and your daughter‚Äôs head, you can work it off, so and so will be here in an hour.‚Äù To that extreme and lesser. But I always feel if I take something that‚Äôs given, I‚Äôm accountable to that person and then have expectation strings attached forever!!

So I stopped accepting help unless it was an immediate even trade. Or in writing what the expectations were in return.

So...my landlord is awesome! I pay well below market value on my house. Every sept and dec he drops rent by $100 to help with back to school and Christmas.
This September the doorknob broke (he lives in another province), so I told him I will pick it up, keep receipt and deduct from rent. He said he would call a handy many to pay to install. I laughed and told him not to be so foolish...it‚Äôs a doorknob (plus one of my triggers is strange men in the house. I don‚Äôt let anyone in! Ever! Just close friends and family). I told him I‚Äôd install. Told me to spend $100 on doorknob, $50 for my time and labour, $100 for back to school and keep the change. I told him I would send him the change ($180!). He refused. I panicked. He talked me into accepting it as part of my education fund I‚Äôve been saving up for so I can earn more money.

Then we spoke about my car. Poor ol Betsy is on her last legs. He told me if I get my course done, he wanted to talk t one about my car too. 

Then he said ‚Äúme, I‚Äôm going to send you the money for your course tomorrow ($1000). I will put a 2% interest rate on it, repayable $20/mo (I pay rent biweekly) and if it takes 5 years then so be it. I said what if I‚Äôm not living here in 5 years? He said well it will be because you either found a good man, or you made it financially, and moved up to better. Then you can pay the rest back as determined now.

All this sounds great. But I‚Äôm terrified!!!
No one has ever done no strings attached. No one in my life. Ever. Everyone always wants something in return. And I‚Äôll feel my course, grades, time it takes me...is all accountable to report to him. Like I didn‚Äôt do it myself. And I need that win. I need to know I fought this hard to earn the money for the course (I‚Äôm so close), and that I did it for us! Not becAuse I was given a hand out.

I had said that line several times. I don‚Äôt want a hand out, I just want a hand up. And I had never said that line to him. He said ‚ÄúI not giving you a handout me, I am just giving you a handout. My mom raised us three boys on her own. I‚Äôve struggled like you and your son. Please let me help you, and help your son.‚Äù

Jesus I wan to believe him! But I‚Äôm so close by myself! So he wouldn‚Äôt let up, kept threatening since he now knew the course and location, if I didn‚Äôt take the loan, he would pay for it himself and register me and then send me the info. And I know he would. So I asked for two months and then revisit. Because I think I can sell enough things, earn enough extra cash, and tuck away just enough cash that I may just be able to come up with the $800 in two months. Just maybe! And if I can, then ‚ÄúI‚Äù did it!! I fought twenty years of ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never amount the anything. You can‚Äôt do it. Just give your daughter up and start over, or just accept you will never become anything anyway.‚Äù I was always told I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù. Fuck everyone! I can! I will! And I need this win!

But, in the same breath on the other hamster wheel, it makes sense to take the help if it‚Äôs genuine. That‚Äôs two months of a course done by then. He wants to sincerely help us. I believe he‚Äôs already shown me by the $100 off sept and dec that there are no strings attached. And yet I‚Äôm terrified.

These things always have a way of biting me in the ass!!!!  Does it make me lesser if I accept his help?
He said when I told him he used a line he couldn‚Äôt possibly known I had used. He took a deep breath and said ‚Äúme, consider me like a guardian angel. You met me when you left your husband, lost your business and fell on horrible times. I just want to see you succeed and strop struggling. That‚Äôs all I want. A good life for your son, and for you to be safe and happy (my most recent relationship was also abusive).

Would you do it?
Would you prefer to do it yourself?
Would you accept the hand up?
What happens if there‚Äôs some sort of string?! What do I do?!

Advice is needed desperately please.
I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm all over the place. The hamster wheels are running like crazy!

I should add, thus far he‚Äôs been an incredibly kind man. Kind of like a father I never had. Super supportive, jumps to fix things, wants to make sure I‚Äôm happy and comfortable and always checks in, not on the house, but on jack and I. He makes sure if we are having a tight month, to make the month a little easier on us. He‚Äôs never asked me for anything in return. No sexual favours, no dates, no anything. Just friendship. I‚Äôm not used to this. Not from men. I‚Äôm sceptical and scared.

What would you do? Both about wiping out $380 in rent for a lock and back to school money?
And the education loan?
Please help me sort this jumbled hamster debate in my head. If you need further info, pls ask. I don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful either. I cried. I don‚Äôt now happy, sad, relieved, scared or this is what having family must be like. Maybe alL those reasons?

Sorry for typos,my fingers are numb (reynauds).

1glph96,PTSD,I need some help ,"Apologies its a bit long. I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. 

So I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didn't work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldn't help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. 

I obviously didn't want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions = less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. 

It started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could (IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl) but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there (lying on a hospital bed) every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die.

They discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. 

I was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didn't have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.

Eventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like I'm right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. 

The worst part is I don't feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks. Anything have any advice on how to deal with this or any tips on how to manage when I have the flashbacks? Any help appreciated.

1dp7krv,PTSD,"23 years later, it all clicks (botched twilight sedation PTSD origin)","\[tw: descriptions of traumatic experience, references to SA and child abuse, difficult psychedelic vision\]

I‚Äôm 58 now. When I was 35 in 2001, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis via colonoscopy during a very stressful time that had flared the bloody symptoms. Only in the last month, mid-2024, have I come to understand that the procedure and following events gave me PTSD, which has only spread covertly to affect more and more areas of my life, without me understanding why. I hope that by finally understanding what happened, I can get better.¬†

I would love to hear how others may have healed from similar experiences.

Before the procedure, through my childhood and early adulthood, I had several extremely unpleasant medical and dental care experiences, especially anesthesia administered via injection, both local and general. Without this history, the one super bad event might have stood out more against the background noise, so maybe I would have better understood why I avoid all medical and dental care. The small incidents cloak the big one.

I have always remembered the events in themselves, but until now I had blocked awareness of their enduring effect. The discovery process has been forensic, correlating plain facts whose connections I had so long avoided making, until all of a sudden: it‚Äôs obvious.

I laid on a gurney in a prep room before the colonoscopy, naked except for an open-back gown, and had an IV put into my left arm. Then they administered a so-called amnesia cocktail that was supposed to leave me in a semi-conscious twilight state of which I would have no memory. It almost worked. I remember coming to hours later, and my friend driving me home super groggy.¬†

A day or two later, the doctor called to tell me that I had ulcerative colitis, its extent and proposed treatment. As I was absorbing this information, almost with relief that it wasn‚Äôt say colon cancer, he indicated that the procedure hadn‚Äôt gone smoothly, and that the staff had even had a chuckle. There had been some struggle. ‚ÄúYour heart rate was too low to give you more anesthesia.‚Äù 

I flashed back to the anesthetist saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give him any more!‚Äù I felt a hot flush, and a rushing sound in my ears, and my spit turned foamy as my heart raced. Tunnel vision. I was having the one of the first few panic attacks of my adult life. I saw my view of the room, where the door was. I had tried to flee. They overpowered me, restrained me to complete the procedure as I lay frozen, collapsed in terror.

I had zero awareness that this was a medical procedure, consensual. My body‚Äôs memory is of being captured and held down by a group of strange men, anally penetrated as my abdomen cramped and spasmed, in a cold room. They were laughing at my clumsy fight and flight attempt, speaking of me in the third person as if their drugs were working. It still feels wrong to liken my experience to that of sexual assault victims. I‚Äôm a veteran, but had a desk job. PTSD? Isn‚Äôt that for those who went through real combat hell or actual rape or something? There‚Äôs no minimizing that I FELT I was being gang raped, through the dark and crazed glass of too much and not enough drugs.

Back then I commuted in hilly San Francisco by bicycle over 100 miles a week. I had a resting heart rate of 39. The anesthetist hadn‚Äôt known this. That‚Äôs why I was under-sedated. My strength became a liability.

I hung up the phone, supposing I would get on with my life and its ongoing stresses. Within the next two years I received and made a series of other phone calls that were horrific in their own separate ways. Terrifying test results of my first child in utero. Legal proceedings against others. Legal proceedings against us. Extortion. The one-time same ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who had driven me home who nearly shook his baby to death, and then sought my complicity in framing our shared nanny. A root canal performed without anesthesia. Relationships shattered. An abortion. The death of a young friend. Being laid off when mortgage payments were over 80% of gross monthly. Surrendering a dear pet because we couldn‚Äôt afford a third emergency surgery. Soon enough I couldn‚Äôt hear the phone ring without all these other traumatic associations rushing in.¬†

Would the colonoscopy doc have admitted in writing the malpractice of not knowing my athletic resting pulse before putting me through that? Every phone call is a now suspicious, somebody attempting to avoid accountability. Even somebody asking my phone number is a trigger. My date of birth, height, weight? Is this a medical intake procedure? Of course you can‚Äôt cancel your overpriced internet service online: you have to call to be put through more manipulation wringers in real time. I‚Äôm on edge every time.

I was a tech worker who viewed the internet in its instant-everywhere textuality as telephony‚Äôs replacement. I‚Äôm also prone to burying difficult feelings in intellectual smokescreens to preserve the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind. I told myself I didn‚Äôt like phone calls because they were 20th-century, impatient, inefficient, leaving no full-text searchable transcript. Textual communication was after all the only way people communicated remotely for most of human history: normal. I was the past and the future in rejecting telephony as a historical aberration. I believed this was a principled position, not a trauma response to having received so much poison, so many lies, threats, manipulations, devastating news and the like in such a short space through faceless tinny electronic voices, intrusive and unaccountable. It was all kicked off by that doctor‚Äôs call, pricking freshly repressed memory into panic.

For the last 23 years, pretty much the only phone calls I make or receive are absolute emergencies, when there is no other way. Which only reinforces the trauma response. An exception was my oldest friend, a lifeline. That friendship ended in heartbreak a decade ago over the phone too. Lacking eye contact, I no longer trust that my voice carries the tone of my heart, nor that my ears hear what is in the heart of others. If I remember calls, I play back the memory for weeks as I am trying to sleep, searching for what I may have said or heard wrongly. I have texted 911. I use TTY. I have never spoken on the phone to my beloved of 11 years, nor to my adult son. Or if I have, I have scrubbed the memories involuntarily. Knowing that I can‚Äôt remember the content of most calls is another reason I refuse them: it makes me unreliable.¬†

I left a business I started in part because my partners and staff could no longer tolerate my inability to deal with customer or sales calls, always deflecting to email. My present business has no phone.

Of all calls, those around medical care are the most difficult. Instant panic, and no memory afterwards. So I have gotten next to no medical care not self-directed, self-administered: ‚Äúan apple a day.‚Äù I have been trying and failing since 2018 to schedule my first cancer screening colonoscopy without using a phone, with active colitis that masks cancer symptoms. I‚Äôve succeeded finally this year in scheduling only by successive walk-ins to urgent care over months of disturbed sleep where I‚Äôve broken down repeatedly into shaking tearful recounts about how I can‚Äôt call, and why.¬†

The intensity of my terror over the next colonoscopy has been key to me uncovering the obvious terror of the first, and how/why I‚Äôve been fucked up ever since.

I got a clonidine prescription. I didn‚Äôt take it today, like I should have, before getting a blood draw in advance of overmorrow's cancer screening. (They changed it from a colonoscopy to a CT scan specifically to skip the anesthesia.) I had another panic attack at the phlebotomist‚Äôs station after she withdrew the needle. She paged overhead for medical emergency assistance as I struggled to recover my breath and come out of the tunnel, embarrassed. I cried in the car.

In 2008, 2 years after my first psilocybin experience, I had a most difficult trip. I finally understand it. High dose, laying on my bed alone in silence: instantly the room blackened and became freezing cold. Gravity multiplied, pressing me into the bed. I felt pure terror as a malevolent godlike force permeated the room. I became a deer bounding through a field in deep snow, fleeing for my life from a pack of wolves in pursuit. I saw a gully ahead, lined with the tops of bare willows poking through the snow. I tried to leap over with all my strength, but the ground fell away beneath my feet, and I plunged into the ravine. The wolves set upon me cackling, tearing into my nethers, ripping out my intestines, eating me alive, red spattering white as I bled out, open-eyed now dissociating, observing from above.

Later in the vision, I found myself coming to in restraints strapped to a hospital bed, handcuffed to the railing, captive. Police had shot me after I had murdered my family in a psychotic fugue. I wept in bitter self-loathing and remorse, muttering that I meant no harm, would do no more harm, renounced violence, embraced punishment of death for the heinous crimes I bore no memory of committing.

What was I to make of this experience of fear and loathing, so pure? Was it to cultivate compassion for prey and predator, in harsh beautiful balance? Was it to fill me with gratitude that none of that had really happened? Was it just a shot across the bow from the universe to lay off the mushrooms?¬†

Now I see that it was to allow me to experience in hyper-real lucidity what the sedation drugs had allowed only the lower animal houses of my body and brain to know. Because we can‚Äôt move past what we cannot fully feel. The cold vulnerability, the literal Panic fear, Pan being the god of the wild hunt in field and forest, the gravity of restraints, the laughter of the feast, the violence to my bowels, the blood, the coming to while still strapped to the gurney, as if I had done something horrible to deserve what had been done to me: all there, as experienced by a deer turned prey, transforming into a captive psychotic murderer shot by police. It‚Äôs taken me 16 years to decipher the trip, processing what happened during a botched twilight sedation just before the towers fell on 9/11.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1dp7krv/23_years_later_it_all_clicks_botched_twilight/,1719430974.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
qun18g,PTSD,"Almost 8 years living with untreated PTSD, please Help","I'll try to keep this short and to the point without babbling too much as it's a habit I've had for a while lol...

I'm a 27 year old man and have only recently (like 1-2 weeks ago) come to the realisation I have probably been living with some form of PTSD for the last 8 years. Up until now I assumed it was just severe anxiety that I exacerbated 8 years ago when I had a very traumatic experience involving a cocktail of drugs on a night out with friends. I developed anxiety and then depression as a teenager when I was around 14, and when my father passed away when I was 19 due to tragic circumstances my depression lifted shortly after and I was left with moderate anxiety. 

About 6 months after his passing I had this bad drug experience when I took MDMA (cut with Speed), drank a lot of alcohol and was on antidepressants (sertaline and mirtzapine as I was coming off the former and had been put on the latter) as I went to a rave with friends. We bombed the MDMA and none of us 'came up' so we just drank beers and cider. Once back at my friends student home I rolled a joint of some strong skunk and had a few tokes before passing it on to a friend. The cannabis must've activated the MDMA in my stomach because quite quickly I felt strange and anxious. For the first hour I sat on the sofa clutching my stomach whilst hunched over, feeling the sensation of pure ecstasy course through my body from my stomach outwards down my arms and legs like waves. My brain went into override and I suffered a continuous negative thought loop where I was convinced I was dying, all the while having this sensation of flushing waves internally. My body eventually rejected what was in my stomach and I spent the next 6 hours throwing up every half an hour or so but the bad trip didn't subside whatsoever until I eventually was able to close my eyes and fall asleep. My puke was initially blood red due to the red cider I had been drinking but my mind had convinced itself it was blood which only added to the terror and dread I was feeling as well as the recurring panic attacks.

After this traumatic event, I smoked weed on two occasions where the feelings of flushing liquid coursing through my body as well as a severe panic attack occurred shortly after getting high. Consuming alcohol would also cause quite severe anxiety, as well as smoking cigarettes and even consuming caffeinated beverages. It felt like any stimulant or drug I took would invoke similar feelings (now I know this all was just triggering my PTSD). The experience also left me with an immense fear of imminent death (or death anxiety as it is known) where almost every time I would become anxious I would think I was dying or going to die, from anything like a pain in my chest being internalised as a possible heart attack, to riding in a car or plane or any vehicle and believing it was definitely going to crash. This death anxiety is still with me today but has gotten less severe over the years. I have now interpreted this as part of the PTSD I developed during that horrible experience 8 years ago.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 23 as I had always believed I had it and demanded my parents pay for assessment so that I might get treatment that would help me with my university studies. Sure enough I was right and was prescribed Elvanse which was not fun at all to take as the side effects were far worse than the benefits it supposedly gave me with focusing better. I have tried microdosing shrooms over 2 separate periods and found they helped immensely with both studying and overall mental wellbeing.

I know I said I wouldn't babble but to me I've given significant information for those well versed in living with PTSD and hopefully there's someone reading this that can relate somewhat to my predicament and has some valuable advice you can offer as this is what the purpose of this post is!

My main reason for sharing this post with you all is to simply ask for advice on what I should do to combat this possible PTSD I've been afflicted with for so long because I've tried many things and am at my wits end and struggling to remain hopeful I can cure it or at least treat it to the point I no longer have death anxiety as it is by far the most debilitating thing I've had to live with (I also have chronic Ulcerative Colitis which is far more manageable).

Meditation is very difficult for me due to my ADHD. I've yet to try yoga. Regular exercise helps lessen my anxiety and improve overall wellbeing but I still feel plagued by this PTSD. I'm thinking of microdosing shrooms again but on a regular basis not just when I am studying and have exams approaching. I have wanted to potentially try DMT at a retreat in Central/South America but cautious as to whether it may make things worse, the same goes for trying psychedelic drugs like shrooms, acid, etc. Bipolar disorder is present on my father's side so I am worried I might trigger a psychotic episode or disorder dormant in me.

If there is anyone who has developed PTSD through a similar experience to me I would love to hear from you and have you share your coping techniques and what treatments you sought out that worked for you (or didn't work for you) with me :)

9x7lhy,PTSD,DH thinks I overreact to health issues,"**TW - very serious health issues**


Years ago I had really bad ulcerative colitis due to stress from long-term abuse, and I ended up having to have my colon removed, which meant having an ostomy bag. At the end before I was hospitalized, I was literally dying of malnutrition and dehydration, and was suffering horribly.

I met DH 2 years later, so he‚Äôs never seen me that sick. I did develop fibromyalgia a year after we got married though, so he has seen me in excruciating pain 24/7. 

When someone has no colon and an ostomy bag, getting a stomach bug or food poisoning (diarrhea) *can be fatal* because we lose liquid and electrolytes faster than our body can absorb them. So if we take an Imodium and it doesn‚Äôt stop the diarrhea within an hour, we have to go to the ER for IVs of fluids and electrolytes *or we can die.*

Once about 5 years ago I got a bug and to go to the ER, but DH has some memory problems and doesn‚Äôt remember. 
 
In May 2015 I had a revision surgery that gave me an internal intestinal pouch that I empty with a catheter (look Ma no bag!) and last night I had bad stomach cramps for the first time since my revision. I was able to go to sleep but was woken up with even worse cramps this morning, and when I emptied my pouch I clearly had diarrhea. I got scared because I didn‚Äôt know the protocols for my type of ostomy, and my number for my surgeon was no longer a working number.

(Normally)D(ear)H was going on a hike with a friend this morning, and I quickly figured out (and confirmed) he thought I was overreacting. I got triggered and frustrated, things got uncharacteristically ugly, and he clammed up and left. 

And I‚Äôm in a fibromyalgia flareup and can‚Äôt drive, so if I needed to get to the hospital or go pick up a prescription I‚Äôd have to get a Lyft. 

Finally reached my surgeon and he said he‚Äôd call in a prescription for me, as well as telling me that with an internal pouch we don‚Äôt need to worry unless I have it for 24 hours. 

So here‚Äôs the deal: DH has PTSD for emotional trauma, and sometimes definitively reacts to situations in ways that someone who doesn‚Äôt have PTSD would think is an overreaction ‚Äî but he still can‚Äôt seem to grasp that *I have that around health issues.* He‚Äôs tired of me ‚Äúcrying wolf over every little thing.‚Äù

I was so scared and got so frustrated by his attitude this morning I told him to fuck off (for the first time in 12 years of marriage) when he tried to give me a goodbye kiss ‚Äî before he walked out on me, and after making it clear he didn‚Äôt believe me about the potential risk of a stomach bug. (We didn‚Äôt know yet that apparently my reaction was totally overboard.)

**Hello, that‚Äôs fucking PTSD!!**

At least he‚Äôs willing to go to my counseling session with me tomorrow so he can hopefully figure out how to handle these situations differently, hence why he‚Äôs a true D(ear)H. 

Edited: We went, and our therapist quickly figured out what was going on. He had just been out of town for nine days and didn‚Äôt have to worry about me, take care of me, etc. This happened two days after he got home, and he suddenly found himself back in the middle of health drama and was feeling resentful.

1luzcf7,PTSD,Could It Be CPTSD If My Therapist Still Says Depression & Anxiety?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been in therapy for about a year and a half now, working under a diagnosis of depression and anxiety.

But over time, I‚Äôve become more and more convinced that I actually have CPTSD ‚Äî based on the childhood trauma, flashbacks, constant fear, how I view the world and relationships, and even certain compulsive behaviors or addictions. Everything about CPTSD just fits in a way that depression/anxiety never fully did.

At the start, I didn‚Äôt tell my therapist about the trauma, flashbacks, or relationship issues ‚Äî so I understand why she started with a depression/anxiety diagnosis. But even after I opened up about those things much later, and even after I took Tim Fletcher‚Äôs CPTSD self-assessment quiz (and scored high), she still insists that it‚Äôs not CPTSD.

She has started using some of Tim Fletcher‚Äôs concepts in therapy with me, which I appreciate. But despite all that, she continues to label my condition as depression and anxiety.

The more I learn about CPTSD, the more I feel seen. I just can‚Äôt unsee myself in what I‚Äôm reading and hearing.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Did your diagnosis evolve over time? Am I just stuck in my head about this?

I recently saw a psychiatrist for about 30 minutes and was prescribed Prozac for a mix of PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and depression. I‚Äôve struggled with intense panic and daily anxiety for years, and currently manage some of it with Xanax and propranolol.

Here‚Äôs the thing: my therapist had me take an ADHD assessment and said I scored in the 90th percentile, but this was never brought up or addressed by the psychiatrist. That feels like a pretty big thing to overlook, especially since ADHD might be a core piece of the puzzle.

To make matters worse, I‚Äôve tried SSRIs before (Celexa and Zoloft) and absolutely hated how they made me feel‚Äîmore anxious, emotionally flat, foggy, disconnected, etc. I‚Äôve also tried Adderall and Ritalin in college and didn‚Äôt enjoy those either, so now I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in this limbo where nothing feels safe to try.

I‚Äôm honestly terrified to take Prozac. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll make my anxiety worse or that I‚Äôll lose my sense of self again. But I‚Äôm also scared of doing nothing. The panic and mental spirals are exhausting me.

I guess I‚Äôm asking:
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone had a similar experience with being misdiagnosed or partially diagnosed?
	‚Ä¢	Should I find a new psychiatrist or go back and tell my current one that she may have missed something major?
	‚Ä¢	And if you‚Äôve had success with Prozac in a similar situation, how long did it take to adjust? Was it worth pushing through the early side effects?

Any thoughts or encouragement would be appreciated. I‚Äôm just really overwhelmed.

The symptoms often manifest as general tenseness and bowel agitation, mainly in the form of LLQ (left-lower quadrant) burning, bloating, and abnormal gurgling and discomfort, in addition to possible abnormal pelvic tightness that likely stems from involuntary body armoring.

1kde2aa,PTSD,Living with PTSD & Depression for Years ‚Äì Looking for Info on End-of-Life Options in California or Elsewhere in the US,"Hi everyone,  
I've been living with complex PTSD and severe depression for many years, stemming from childhood trauma. I've tried therapy, medications, support groups, and more, but the emotional pain has never truly lifted. I often feel like I'm carrying a weight that just won't go away.

I know California has the End of Life Option Act, and I wonder if there's **any way to qualify** under this law, or any other path for someone in my condition to be legally allowed to end life peacefully.

This isn't a post made impulsively ‚Äî I'm genuinely trying to understand what options are available and whether mental health suffering is ever considered valid under current legal frameworks.

If anyone has personal experience, professional insight, or knows someone who's navigated this, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input.

I used to be a very thoughtful and emotional person that was very self aware.

Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what tf my brain is even doing. I experienced some pretty severe trauma SA as well as some childhood and relationship trauma. The SA is what really put the nail into the coffin so to speak. After the SA it‚Äôs like my brain checked out. I can‚Äôt focus unless I try really really hard. I don‚Äôt really have a long term memory anymore or much of a short term either. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know what year it is and my sense of time has gone out the window. I can‚Äôt even remember simple things like names of songs, or movies I‚Äôve watched (it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching it for the first time). Before the incident I was really smart and now I can‚Äôt even recall even small details. I can remember the first letter of something sometimes if I‚Äôm attempting to recall it. Even with my surroundings, I can‚Äôt remember where I‚Äôve been or recognize an area I‚Äôve been to multiple times. My friends and family joke I have early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs but I am 24. I‚Äôve done therapy, and I have been on countless medications to correct the PTSD and melancholic symptoms of the trauma. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since the incident, which wasn‚Äôt something I was suffering from before the trauma. I‚Äôm just starting to get worried because it seems to be affecting my speech, forgetting the words to explain what I‚Äôm talking about mid-sentence. I know what disassociating is, but I‚Äôm not sure that is the case because I feel completely present and not like I‚Äôm spacing off. It‚Äôs like I am experiencing my life and what is around me but my brain is somehow not logging the information into my brain to be recalled. Sometimes when I‚Äôm listening to someone telling me something it just seems like it‚Äôs going in one ear and out the other because if you would ask me what was just said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to remember. The issue is I‚Äôm not sure what to do about it to get my brain to start functioning like it used to‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 24 and I shouldn‚Äôt have this many issues with my memory. It‚Äôs been almost 7 years since the traumatic incident and I thought I would‚Äôve returned to normal by now.

1dbod8m,PTSD,Dissociative amnesia anyone?,"I've recently found out that I'm missing very large chunks of memory from a 6 year time span. It sucks not knowing what I've forgotten, and realizing that my brain decided to start blocking my life out indiscriminately regardless of good or bad. I certainly still remember super traumatic events. It's like the mechanism for moving memory storage into the trash bin of my brain wasn't calibrated enough. Hell, I don't even know how much of my current life I'm remembering, if that makes sense. It's scary to find out some of the things I've forgotten because well...I didn't know I forgot them. 

My best friend will bring up trips, conversations, events, and I'm like ""no that must have been some other friend"".. and then I find a picture and I go ""no that's definitely me.""

Another weird thing I'm noticing it is the fact that I frequently think people who I know but haven't seen recently are years younger than they are. 

I've started watching shows that I *know* I've watched before (like literally a year ago), and it's all brand new to me. No recollection. 

I'm afraid my memory is so messed up that I won't be able to properly retain memories of the things I'm living through now. It terrifies me that I don't realize what information won't get stored, and I don't know how to tell if my brain is healing enough that this survival mechanism is still ongoing or not.

175p1ex,PTSD,Can you have PTSD from being a Caretaker?,"So a little background about me.. Growing up throughout high school and all of my life since, we have always had someone in the home that we were taking care of. In high school it was my grandma on my mom's side who had Alzheimers, up until when we had to put her in a nursing home; not long after doing so my brother who has Huntingtons disease moved back home as his symptoms were getting worse. (small explanation Huntingtons disease presents similar to Parkinson's and so my brother would have muscle spasms he couldn't control and lose his balance frequently, along with having muscular problems so we always were keeping an eye on him and listening to make sure he hadn't fallen during the night etc. His room was below mine so there was more than one occasion where he fell during the night and I heard him and had to jump up in the middle of the night to go get my parents to help. 

While caring for my brother as his symptoms increased, my grandfather on my dads side was diagnosed with cancer and several other conditions that made it unsafe for him and my granny to live alone so they then also moved in with us. At this point we were having to keep a watch on my brother and my grandpa for a while, until last year when my brother progressed so that it wasn't safe for him to be at home anymore, so he is in a nursing home now. Earlier this year we lost my grandpa which is still really affecting me. 

It's now been about 3-4 months of not having someone in our home that was needing care 24/7 who isn't a fall risk, etc. I find I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking I am hearing my brother calling for help, or hearing a loud noise and still get that immediate panic thinking my grandpa fell again. 

Recently I find myself worrying to leave my granny at home by herself. She is still completely independent and not had any issues except for some back pain, but she is doing amazing for a woman in her 80s, so it feels stupid to worry this much about it, but all I can think is the worst, what if something happens and no one is home?

I know no one can diagnose me here, but I guess I just am looking for some support and hoping I am not the only one who has dealt with these feelings, and hoping someone has some advice.

1bjsxhu,PTSD,Finally got help. Don't ignore the red flags,"Tldr in bottom

Was bullied a lot in my childhood (I was a obese pale norwegian boy going living in a rural town in Spain), by students and teachers. The school was also a prestigious private school with homework during weekends and vacations, and upto 40 hours per week.

 After I moved home, my dad got Alzheimers disease when I was 14 and the stories at the ""care home"" are just horrible. I got into fitness, stopped drinking heavily and lost 35 kilos and my body is healthier than ever.

My mind however, not. All those years of bullying, by everyone around me from neighbourhood kids to teachers to ""nurses and caregivers"" at the home, while being the man of the house with 3 jobs and a straight A-student finally took a toll on me at 21 years old.

I have suffered from depression on and off since I was 14, but it was manageble. My dad was my primary physician, but at that point he started to loose grasp on certain medical aspects, mental health included and we sort of didnt talk aboit it anymore.

When I was on vacation in June 2022 the care home severely fucked up and transferred my dad with 1 day notice to a completely incompetent part of the building where he was neglected and almost died of pneumonia when I was 4000 miles away. 

 After a very challenging episode in November 2023 where I was framed for something I didn't do (can get into specifics later), I couldn't get the thought of killing myself and the eternal relief of peace and quietness out off my head. I was scared of the fact that I could convince myself to think that suicide was the correct solution. Went to my GP for regular checkups and Setraline. Everything was going smooth

In late January 2024 I has an insanely powerfull relapse. In one of my workplaces, there is a huge machine to compress cardboard. I had to grab the handles to prevent myself from jumping in. 

Got an emergency appointment and was admitted to psychiatric care where I was quickly evaluated by a psychologist with a PhD in traumatic incidents, and I absolutely love this guy. After two appointments I got diagnosed with Complex PTSD, Severe Depression and Chronical Motor Tics, and I am under evaluation for ADHD.

Sometimes I wonder if all of this could have been avoided if I got help sooner. If 14 year old me had the courage to stand up to society and past the ""male mental health stigma"" (in my country at least), and just told someone.

Aftermath: I am scared of hospitals, scrubs, I always have to call my mom if im outside for more than 3 hours and I can't be more than an hour away from home by myself without having a oanick attack.

1fsaero,PTSD,I was a former CNA who interrupted a patients suicide attempt. They eventually passed and I feel guilt from it daily.,"Hello everyone. I don‚Äôt talk about this much but I feel like counseling isn‚Äôt helping. 

I was a CNA at an Assisted Living and Memory Care (MC) facility approximately 3 years ago and had a patient in MC who had parkinson‚Äôs related lewy-body dementia in their early 80s. The patient had lost their spouse a year earlier due to COVID-19 and was depressed due to this.

Despite constant updates to nurses and doctors on the condition of their depression and treatment of the depression with the best due diligence they could, the patient continued to display signs and symptoms of depression. Treatment wasn‚Äôt working.

One day at dinner time, after the patient had finished eating, went up to other patients and thanked them for their kindness and thanked us (the aides and nurses) for our help. I seemed to be the only CNA who noticed that this was abnormal as the patient would usually be introverted and self-kept. I followed the patient to their room from a far distance because I was concerned for the behavior change. The patient went into their room and locked the door. We have keys that access every door in case of emergency or concern. I noted that this patient never used to lock their door and went in. The patient‚Äôs bathroom door was shut. If anyone has ever worked in Memory Care before, you‚Äôll know that almost NONE of their MC patients shut the bathroom door, even if they are currently having a BM so it was clear something was off. 

I opened the door and the patient was attempting to use a braided charging cord to hang himself from his shower curtain rod. The cable was provided by family to charge a device. It was around his neck and tied and he was trying to tie the other end to the rod. I was able to successfully move the patient away from the rod and removed the cord from their neck, while additionally calling on my radio for an additional aid or nurse. Another aid showed up and helped me get the patient to a safe location where they could be monitored. I notified the nurse on duty (who was on lunch at the time) of the situation and 911 was called. The patient was taken to a nearby geriatric psychiatry unit.

The patient returned two weeks later, bed bound. They were unable to feed themselves, speak, or even show major emotion. The unit had completely killed this persons brain via psychotropic drugs due to the incident. The patient immediately was put on hospice and died a month later. I was apart of their hospice care as well.

The family was always supportive and knew it was ‚Äútheir time to go‚Äù and was very thankful of our services. At the end of the day, however, I feel like I could have done something better to prolong the patients life. But we already had notified the PCP, they were on depression regiments and was being monitored. Nothing else could have been done in that situation in my shoes as a basic CNA.

No matter what I‚Äôm told by family, peers or even counselors that I did the right thing and it was not preventable, I still feel a great amount of guilt and blame for the reason the patient tried to commit. I don‚Äôt understand fully why I still to this day think about them without any triggers and it makes me have intense psychological symptoms. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to get past these symptoms due to the situation that happened. I know this is probably the stupidest thing to have PTSD about but I feel like I truly failed myself and my patient. I feel like I should have done more when nothing else could be done. Does anyone have advice on how to challenge these negative thoughts, especially due to interrupting suicide?

I know it is what she believes is best for her and her 3 kids but i cant help but feeling like she abandoned me..

1lbe2m6,PTSD,I feel lost (I was kidnapped and illegaly deprived of freedom),"I am not officaly diagnosed with PTSD yet, but all the symptoms do check up.
But if I'm actually gonna try to change my official diagnosis from schizophrenia to PTSD this would be a looot of work.
Why you might ask? Cuz I live in the 2nd world country.

Im a male in my early 20s.
So the thing is that I was abused by the initiative of my own family (although I'm an orphan since the age of 5, so my legal parent used to be a mom of my sister which i share a father with).

And the thing is that I don't even see a point to try right now to do anything. My head is a mess after months of being drugged with antipsychotics.

It feels hopeless trying to rebuild everything that my life used to be before the abuse.

Aaand by abuse I mean something that some legal practice would consider as torture.
You could say that I was tortured for almost a year being deprived of just a basic right to sleep.

Before the kidnapping I was as far from being labeled as mentally ill as possible.

But after almost a year of abuse I started experiencing psychotic symptoms.
Right now I have some partial amnesia regarding these days.
So after several days of so-called psychosis (and of being tied to bed for several nights and left alone) my relative had taken me out of that place and drove me off to psychiatric facility.

And by living in a country with poor protection of human righrs of course they just labeled me as schizophrenic (although my foster mother has told me that the first diagnosis they told her was ""dementia"").

So yeah, then there was more abuse, but in a less sadistic way.

Long story short after stopping taking the meds and being off them for almost half a year I started experiencing strong symptoms of PTSD.

Although it seems like I will move out of this sick, sick household very soon (thanks to some acquaintances of mine) !!! But I really do experience strong psychological flashbacks of being in the place where I was illegally deprived of freedom. And all the other symptoms of PTSD I experience too in one way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1lbe2m6/i_feel_lost_i_was_kidnapped_and_illegaly_deprived/,1749921961.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1jarde3,PTSD,Feeling forgotten!!,"So where do I begin.. 
My life has been a bumpy ride since birth, I was born not breathing. Heard many times my mom speak about the nightmare she lived while I was not responding. But I'm here so as a kid I had that ""I'm here for something"" mentality, child like wonder I guess.
But, life was not a happy fairytale for me.. I was abused,  beat, bullied, used, attacked, and made to feel like I'm a mistake!

Why can't you be like my friends sons, why arent you as smart, I'm so ashamed you are my kid. Smacks in the back of my head for forgetting to walk the dog, kicks down steps because I wanted to play with my friends, instead of going to the race track. 

When you are broken, school becomes a refuge, at least it did for me.. Until the abuse began at school as well. Get away no one likes you, ahh why did you invite him, hey this girl likes you, go around the corner she's there. To find 20 kids laughing calling me ugly. 

Now as I got older I learned that if people are afraid of you, theyre not going to prank you in front of the whole school. So I learned how to make people fear what I would do to them, and that worked in a sense..i didn't become a bully, I became a bully to the  bullies! 
But that's not me, it was more of a survival thing. 

Went to college and finally felt my life was how it should be. I no longer had issues with bullies, girls were there now, and I didn't have to hear I'm a loser by people anymore. 
But all the abuse, all the fear as a child, the nightmares all were there, just hidden I know now. Then the tragedies began! 
Lost my Godfather first, then my mom, then my sister, then my child and wife. When life couldn't smack me any more, my father is also taken from me. (this is just a few loses ive taken, I essentially have lost my entire family and beyond). 

I went from happy, to a broken down lifeless zombie, just going through the paces. This is when I saw a neuropsychiatrist who finally told me what no one else had. You suffer from severe ptsd, and this is why. 
All the physical, mental, and emotional abuse became too much for my brain to handle. 

Im already showing signs of early stage dementia, and I cry randomly almost on a daily basis. Nightmares, racing pulse, confusion, added to the mix moments of rage that scares even myself. If the phone rings I jump because I'm afraid it's another call telling me someone died. If I'm at the store, I may have to leave because all the people becomes overwhelming, and I start sweat and my body shakes/trembles like when you are shivering. 

My friends, relatives, co workers, past co workers have pretty much forgotten about me. I feel like maybe I'm soo messed up, that it's me that is the problem. I'm always alone, I do not get invited to places, I spend the holidays alone, my birthday alone.. Even if I put it out there that I'm going through it, no one reaches out. 
I say when I'm gone maybe they'll have regret, but why should have to die, for people to see they weren't there when I needed them.

Am i that horrid that being around me is such a task, ill blame myself and say no one wants to be around sad people, but if you're my friend that shouldn't matter right. No one will contact me and say hey buddy let's go get a beer and watch a game. But they will msg me and tell me I'm wrong for sharing that I'm sad/depressed, because people don't want to see that. 

Im sitting alone as I text this, no calls, no texts, no emails, no visits, no invites. Just loneliness, constant loneliness! Everyone has moved on, and I was left behind! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1jarde3/feeling_forgotten/,1741912424.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1m108kl,IBS,Colonoscopy prep specific to IBS/IBD?,"Greetings folks. Over the last few months, I've developed what I think is IBS, or something similar, maybe colitis. I took a blood test recently, and found that I am borderline low on folate. I've been eating potatoes and eggs to make up for the lack of energy low folate creates.

I've been on a low fodmap diet and it has really provided a lot of relief. However, what I am finding is, when I eat more than 1 scoop of Sunfiber prebiotic fiber supplement, I develop a major flareup. i.e., my gut gets very irritated for a day or 2.

Then I go back to the low fodmap diet and feel fine. I am still interested in getting a colonoscopy done, but I am very concerned about the bowel prep: if I get a flareup by having just 2 scoops a day of prebiotic fiber supplement (not to mention it is a low-fodmap fiber supplement), then how the heck can I handle swallowing a whole Miralax, and all that Dulcolax??? Anyone had similar experiences?

Are there different bowel preps that help with my situation, to make it far less painful? And are there other alternative diagnostics (and I am not talking about Cologuard, because that is not very accurate) that are less invasive and involve less prep? I've heard about intestinal ultrasounds, and that they're pretty accurate.

Just wondering if there are any suggestions and alternatives people have had experience with, who are in a similar situation to mine.

1etjuaw,IBS,20 years dealing with IBS-D and IBD and I can give some advice.,"Hi everyone. I'm not cured. I'm now travelling and more or less functional.

Who am I? I'm the reason why the ""success stories"" filter exists. Back in 2017 / 2018 under a different account, I proposed we should have that flair to encourage people to share their successes and help others and the mods implemented it. Back in the day also created a list of diseases that could explain IBS symptoms, etc. I also have my own subreddit with a bot that will help people with stomach stuff.

I have IBS-D so not all of this will apply to those with IBS-C. As I mentioned earlier, I don't always believe in IBS-M because often that is the result of Imodium abuse... but more about that later.

**Anxiety and stress:** Yes, this unfortunately affects / worsens ibs. If you are worried about something, if you have job / money problems, etc. This can go to your stomach. Almost every problem in life has a solution.

Even talk about your IBS problems with people. We all poo. I opened about this with a girl and she told me she had similar issues but with pee (she is very ashamed of peeing in public). Also more than once I was having a date with a girl and she went to the toilet after a big meal and had to poo. And it's normal. We need to normalise pooing and telling people that we have a problem.

Change job, studies, make a list of your life problems, work on them. It takes time.

**Diet:** a lot of you are lactose intolerant, so stop consuming dairy. It's like 70% of the worlds population is lactose intolerant. It sucks, I know, I also am.

Sodas are terrible. Both sugar and non sugar versions. Drink mostly water first and then see.

Fruits and vegetables, although they are ""healthy"" they can be very bad in excess for people with IBS-D.

I mostly consume animal meat and potatoes/rice. Then I add some fruits and veggies in small quantities here and there.

Oily foods can be a problem, avoid too much oil.

Try to eat low in FODMAP.

Chew a lot.

After one week under a minimalist diet of mostly meat and rice/potatoes and water, start adding new things and see what you can tolerate and what you cannot.

Do not over eat.

**Imodium:** A few pills per week maybe is okay. Every day use? 3+ pills per day? oh... please. Your body gets used to it. You become addicted and build tolerance. I use it once per week, sometimes. Other people use it once per day. Do not abuse it. It can cause constipation too and fake ""IBS-M"" diagnosis.

**Other medications:** Cholestiramine and similar bile acid medications can help people with IBS-D. Talk with your doctor. Vitamines in general or vitamine D help some people.

**Probiotics:** Try which probiotics work for you. Not all will help but some yes. A better microbiome, better gut health.

**Enzymes:** Some people benefit for taking them as well.

**Studies:** Get studies for parasites and all the known diseases as well to rule out IBS. Take biopsies when possible. There is SIBO, IBD, etc, not only IBS.

**Exercise:** Walking, being a bit under the sun everyday, running, lifting some weights a few times per week. This all helps.

**FMT:** some people got help doing Fecal microbiota transplant.

1khoy4g,IBS,"Thought it was IBS-D, turns out it was Crohn's","TLDR: Get your colonoscopy. (And maybe small bowel capsule if that's negative) 

Around 9 months ago my stools changed and started alternating between flat/ribbon-like and diarrhea. 4-6 stools per day most days, depending on what I ate. FODMAP helped a tad, but didn't totally solve my problems. I saw my PCP who ordered generic labs (cbc/cmp/thyroid) and a heme-occult test. Everything looked fine except for the heme-occult, which was positive. Referred to GI who recommended a colonoscopy. I did ""play up"" my symptoms a tad. Exaggerated the amount/frequency of pain I had, said I was seeing blood in the toilet bowl when I wasn't etc. Colonoscopy was done a month later and *looked like* Crohns per the GI doc, and I'm still waiting on biopsies, but he wants me to start Budesonide/Humira as soon as possible. 

I'm honestly pretty devastated to have this diagnosis. To be sure, it's better than some other diagnoses, but it's still pretty scary.

1jpourm,IBS,Could it possibly be Crohn‚Äôs,"Since my late twenties I have gone through hell with my stomach. Originally it was intense burning and sharp stabbing pains in my intestines. An endoscopy was done and I was diagnosed with acute gastritis and acid reflux. Later on the pains became more severe and I had issues keeping food inside me. Every morning I wake up in pain and with the urge to use the bathroom, however the pain does not go away afterwards, instead it intensifies and no matter what I eat I still become very sick. I‚Äôve had two colonoscopies and three endoscopies done over the years and have been diagnosed with 11 different stomach conditions with my doctor telling me it‚Äôs all just IBS, gastritis, and a hernia. I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just that and had even asked him if there was a possibility I had Crohn‚Äôs due to the severity of my symptoms. He told me Crohn‚Äôs is horrible and that I don‚Äôt have it but I felt he was just being dismissive.

The flare ups I have effect me greatly. I become very fatigued, end up with vicious headaches and bouts of fevers and chills. All of this makes me think my body is attacking itself which would make it autoimmune and that is the number one symptom of Crohn‚Äôs.

bujy3a,IBS,I made a comprehensive guide for those of you lurkers who suffer from extreme constipation,"**I now maintain an updated and more user-friendly version of this guide at /r/ConstipationAdvice.**


I've seen that many of you have chronic constipation but you do not understand why you have it, and your general practitioner doctors either don't think you have an issue or don't know what to do.


I know how you feel. I know what it's like to not even feel like a human being because you can't go to the bathroom like everyone else. It is frustrating and depressing, and not something you can just go around telling people.


I hope this guide helps you a ton.


**BECOME A DETECTIVE**


Keep this in mind as you proceed: your disorder is a puzzle. All you have to do is solve it. You can do it, if you have a great deal of patience, persistence, and commitment. Become your own investigator. Figure out your digestive cycle and your body's language. Listen to your body. Keep notes - I'm talking handwritten or typed notes, anything that will help you make a paper trail.


**Women:** I have left a special note for you at the bottom regarding the additional problems you face when dealing with doctors. Please read it.

**WHY I MADE THIS GUIDE**


I'm a (mostly) healthy, physically active 31-year-old male. I have spent years seeing doctors, reading studies, accosting and interrogating medical professionals and pharmacists, calling pharmaceutical companies, and generally being an interrogator to anyone who has information that could help improve my life. This post is the aggregation of my conclusions and recommendations.


In 2012 I got constipated. I grabbed an OTC laxative and was fine after that. But then the constipation happened again a few months later. It became more frequent, going from once a month to once a week, to every day. As of 2016, I was completely unable to eliminate without the use of pharmaceutical drugs.


It took seven years for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me. I made this post because I want to help some of you turn my 7-year journey into a 7-month journey.


Print this guide out and keep it with you. I've done all the heavy lifting for you. I did all of these myself, and now I want to help you. You will spend money on all of this, but it will change your life. You will be glad you did it.


----------------------


**QUESTIONS FOR YOU**


If you suffer from severe chronic constipation, you need to answer the following questions, write them down, and bring them to your doctor:


* Do you have the urge to go, but you cannot? Or do you have zero urge to go? (this is the most important question)


* Do you have alternating diarrhea and constipation, or just constipation?


* Do you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety (getting full really early into a meal)?


* Have you had this issue since childhood, or did it begin in teen years/adulthood/after a major life event (surgery? divorce? car accident? mauled by bears?)


* Did you in the past or do you currently take any medications that could damage your intestines? The acne drug Accutane/Sotret/Claravis/many other names (isotretinoin) has been linked to serious conditions of the digestive tract. I am absolutely convinced that my large intestine was destroyed by this drug. Antibiotics are also a major culprit in ruining the small intestine microbiome and causing diarrhea/constipation disorders. Antidepressants can ruin the serotonin balance in the gut as well.


* Did you suffer sexual abuse as a child? There is a high degree of correlation between childhood sexual abuse and adult constipation disorders. Meaning, a lot of people with chronic constipation disorders in adulthood experienced trauma when they were young. This sort of thing must be investigated by *both your doctor and a therapist in coordination*. Do some Googling on this topic if you believe this might be your issue.


**If you have the urge but cannot go**, you very likely have [Pelvic Floor Dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor_dysfunction), especially if you are a woman who has had children. Other indicators of PDF are pain during sex and incontinence. Sorry, but your test is the [anorectal manometry](https://motilitysociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Anorectal-Manometry-Patient-Information-8-5-2005.pdf) - have fun! It can sometimes be treated. Alternatively, you might have a bowel obstruction or a tumor. Your doctor must test for these.


**If you have zero urge to go to the bathroom**, you very likely have a nerve or muscle disorder of the large intestine. These are called [motility disorders](https://www.columbiadoctors.org/childrens-health/condition/gastrointestinal-gi-motility-disorder#:~:text=GI%20motility%20disorders%20are%20digestive,food%20through%20the%20digest%20system.). This is what I have. The most common are Slow-Transit Constipation, Chronic Idiopathic Constipation, and the dreaded Colonic Inertia. Both are extremely frustrating and difficult to treat. It is especially likely that you've got one of these conditions if you have no associated pain or any other symptoms. Your current gastroenterologist likely specializes in IBS; tell him you want a **motility specialist** or a **neurogastroenterologist**.


**If you have constipation sometimes and diarrhea sometimes**, you very likely have IBS-C or a rare form of colitis, or a combination of issues. You may have a nervous condition. Outside chance you have Crohn's Disease. You must be checked for intestinal ulcers/irritation/inflammation, and also for food intolerances and allergies. A buddy of mine had ""IBS"" for many years, but then later discovered he was allergic to tuna, shellfish, pistachios, and fructose. 


**If you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety**, you very likely have [general gastroparesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroparesis), where your entire GI tract is sluggish. I'm sorry to say that this is very difficult to treat and a horrible disease. You must see a neurogastroenterologist, AKA a gastroenterologist who specializes in motility disorders, and you must also see a neurologist to test for autonomic neuropathy. You need a prokinetic motility drug like cisapride, domperidone, prucalopride, etc. Don't go on cisapride unless you have excellent heart health and make sure the doctor keeps an eye on your heart at all times.


**If you have experienced constipation since childhood**, you might have [Hirschsprung's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung%27s_disease) and you need a neurogastroenterologist (a special type of gastroenterologist who studies nerves and motility) to diagnose it by taking a [Full-Thickness Biopsy](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/486390). This is a major surgery and you should try to exhaust all other options first. The Full-Thickness Biopsy comes with its own potentially serious side effects. 


**If you took heavy medications that could possibly have caused your issue**, first write out a timeline of events and try to remember exactly when you took the medication and when your issues started. Write down the progression of symptoms and severity. Bring it with you to your doctor appointments. Correlation does not imply causation, but you are a detective now and you need to follow every lead.


You need to *insist* to your GP that you want to see a **gastroenterologist** (a specialist of your digestive tract, from your mouth to your anus). You need to advocate strongly for yourself because nobody else is going to do it for you. You have to be aggressive in your appointment-making, follow-ups, call-backs, consultations, and arguing with your insurance company about getting your specialty medications covered.


You have to do it yourself. You have to fight. If you don't, you will suffer alone. Nobody is going to save you but you. It's time to get smart and tough about your condition.


------------------------


**THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS**


You are embarking on a journey to improve your health and to discover the cause of your digestive issues. Rather than force you to stumble upon these facts yourself, I'm just going to lay them out for you:


1. Your general practitioner (AKA ""family doctor"") does not know anything about your condition. He is not an expert in diseases of the large intestine. With a few exceptions, he is a gatekeeper for the experts that actually can help you. He will only refer you to these experts after you complete a few basic tests. Do them quickly.


2. The specialist your GP refers you to is also probably not an expert in your condition. Once you arrive at the specialist's office, ask him what his specific expertise is. It took me a year to realize that my specialist was an expert in *liver cancer*. Womp womp. Your disorder is likely in your large intestine, and your specialist may have spent the years of his fellowship removing nodules from the esophagus. **Ask him who he knows that is an expert in motility disorders, and if he doesn't know anyone, tell him to find one and send you there.**


3. You have to elbow your way through the medical system like a Muay Thai fighter if you want to get anywhere. Make your GP give you a referral to a specialist. Make that specialist refer you to the *right* specialist. Make *that* specialist order a bunch of tests. Then make him lay out a treatment plan for you.


4. Your insurance is going to act like all of your tests and prescriptions are ""experimental."" Experimental is insurance-code for ""F*ck you, we aren't paying for this."" The magic spell to banish this bullshit is the phrase ""medically necessary,"" and only your specialist has the power to utter it. Make sure he does, on all of your prescriptions and test orders.


5. Your digestion operates in a cycle - just like your sleep cycle. Pay attention to it, listen to it, memorize it. Know the foods your body hates, know what throws your cycle off, know what improves it. Most importantly, once you have the cycle memorized, track its rhythm over a long period of time. After a year or two, you may notice some changes to the cycle. This information is key.


-------------------


**TESTS YOU PROBABLY NEED**


First, work your way through the following tests with your general practitioner:


1. *Standard blood panel* to check for any really wacky levels/deficiencies


2. *Celiac blood panel* to eliminate the small possibility that you have Celiac


3. *Fecal blood test*. Blood = tumors, ulcers, or perforations


Then, once you have a referral to a gastroenterologist, have him perform the following tests:


4. *Extensive stool cultures*: look for rare parasites. Small chance you have [SIBO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099351/), very small chance you have [SIFO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25786900), very very small chance you have a [Clostridium infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3391391/) that paralyzes the bowels. Ask the doctor to ensure Clostridia are tested for.


5. *Extensive thyroid panel* (sometimes hypothyroidism causes gastroparesis / slow gut transit. This one's an EASY FIX; pray you have this one). You want a full workup, not the standard one.


6. *SITZ Marker Study*: The lab will not know what this is or why you're doing it. Follow the doctor's instructions carefully. Do not take laxatives during this study (it lasts a week) because the point is to identify which specific part of your large intestine is broken (ascending, transverse, descending, rectum). If you accelerate transit by taking laxatives, you will give the lab a false result and it will screw up your treatment.


7. *Endoscopy with small bowel aspirate and biopsy; and colonoscopy with biopsy*: If you're under 30 your doctor will fight you on this. He is an obstacle. Defeat him. Also, specify that you want two types of biopsies performed: a normal biopsy of the small intestine to check for Celiac and Crohn's, and an eosinophilia biopsy to check for allergies. They won't do this unless you specifically request it. Don't screw up the pre-op prep, no matter how hungry you get. If your condition is severe enough, ask about the Full-Thickness Biopsy which tests for ganglionic nerve density / Hirschsprung's disease. This is a very serious surgery and I urge you to get a second opinion before having it done.


8. *Anorectal manometry and MR Defacography:* The anorectal manometry is critically important for people with severe constipation disorders. It really sucks to get it done, but do it.


The AM / MRD test suite is sometimes described as a ""motility workup"" and it can only be performed at highly specialized GI clinics. You will need to pressure your doctor to help you find one, tell him to contact your insurance company and declare these tests *medically necessary*. This is a battery of humiliating tests to determine if you have PFD or another nerve-related motility disorder. If you have a good sense of humor and are capable of relaxing in embarrassing situations, it'll be easy.


9. *CT Scan with contrast*: This is the one where you drink the radioactive dye and lay down inside a space ship. The point is to find tumors, divurticula, obstructions, etc. Ask the radiologist what s/he sees. Sometimes they'll slip up and tell you. They can't say ""You don't have cancer"" (that's for your doctor to determine) but they can say ""I don't see any tumors."" 


**Risks:** Some redditors have expressed disagreement with the CT scan's former position on this list (it was higher up), citing the patient's exposure to radiation as dangerous. They argue a CT scan should only be performed after a colonoscopy. To be clear, a CT scan exposes you to much more radiation than a regular X-ray, but only about 1 in 2000 people develop cancer as a result of a CT scan, and that cancer generally occurs late in life. The reality is, the purpose of the scan is to help diagnose and treat a condition that is debilitating and potentially dangerous to you *right now*, and you are weighing that benefit against the potential prospect of cancer later in life. Talk with your doctor about the risks vs benefits. Ask him/her if you should do it before or after a colonoscopy. 


You will have a diagnosis after these tests.


**If none of these tests result in a clear diagnosis:** see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/bujy3a/i_made_a_comprehensive_guide_for_those_of_you/f7m3wkp/) for next steps.


-----------------


**TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS**


**Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. Make sure to clear each of these with your doctor before proceeding. Do not gamble with your own health.**


Cycle through these home remedies and request these medications from your doctor, in roughly the following order:


* Do all the **stupid fiber crap** just so you can tell your doctor to shut up about it. Fiber does not help people with motility disorders (people like you, probably). It will not help you - unless you have a lack of the *Prevotella* bacterium in your gut microbiome. Increasing your roughage intake and eating a plant-based diet will increase your *Prevotella* count, and might alleviate your condition. If the extra fiber constipates you more, move on.


* Cut out all **dairy** immediately for a month. Dairy is delicious and makes live worth living, but it is disgusting and terrible for you. Almond milk, almond milk ice cream, rice milk, dark chocolate...get used to it.


* Cut out all **gluten** for a month and stick to it. Wheat is insanely hard to digest for almost all people and it causes nothing but problems for people with bowel disorders. Even if your Celiac panel comes back negative, you still might have Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity, which is still being researched but quite prominent. Many people immediately see results after cutting gluten. But look out - the shit's in BBQ sauce, soy sauce, it's in the air, it's in the water, it's in your pillow, it's *everywhere*. It's as if the USDA has an agreement with US farmers to sprinkle wheat in literally every f*cking food product.


* Try the [FODMAP diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-fodmap-diet) and stick to it. Eliminate all potential dietary causes of your constipation, then reintroduce them one at a time to identify the culprit. For 90% of you, diet has nothing to do with your constipation. You have a nerve disorder. As a rule of thumb, grains are all difficult to digest and should be avoided, but I've found that potato and corn are easiest, rice is a bit harder, and wheat and oat are the worst. No idea about quinoa. I strongly recommend sweet potato as a healthy filler replacement for breads. It doesn't even need butter!


* Try a few high-quality **probiotics**. People with intestinal motility disorders have different gut microbiota than normal people, but scientists aren't sure which is the cause and which is the result. A [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288092/) showed that *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Prevotella* are significantly reduced in people with functional constipation disorders, and their *clostridia* counts were higher. (*Clostridia* is bad and requires antibiotics. You can determine if you have this by asking your doctor for a Clostridia-specific stool culture test.) Try [Visbiome](https://www.visbiome.com/), VSL#3 if you can find/afford it. Also, try one of [these](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-probiotics-for-constipation-17940859). You want enteric-coated capsules that are not broken down by your stomach acid so they make it to your intestines.


* **Miralax (polyethylene glycol)** is your first line of defense. It's a chemically inert (non-reactive) substance that you mix in water and chug. It's an osmotic laxative, meaning it does not stimulate the nerves/muscles in the intestines. It draws water into the bowel and flushes you out. It works slowly; it might take several days to work. The mainstream medical consensus is that polyethylene glycol is extraordinarily safe and can be used in babies, the elderly, etc. It can be used for years and years. However, there is some evidence now that it's bad for the environment and probably not as good for people as we thought. I'm ignorant of chemistry, but polyethylene sure sounds like plastic to me.


* If you need fast relief, go to a health food store with a supplement section and buy a bottle of **Magnesium Citrate powder**. It must be citrate, and it must be powder. Mix 450mg (usually a heaping teaspoon) into a tall glass of water and chug it as fast as you can. Do this on an empty stomach in the morning before breakfast. If your disorder is mild, you will have to take a dump *immediately*. Don't get in the car to go to work for a little bit. MagCit is extremely safe and effective. Doctors prescribe it to old people for years and years with no side effects. But if you have renal disorders (kidney problems) talk to your doctor before trying this.


I find that MagCit works best for me right before bed. I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee out all the water I chugged, but in the morning, I generally am able to empty. By the way, MagCit is also an osmotic laxative.


* **Cayenne pepper capsules** have been used in combination with magnesium citrate with great success in some people. The pepper stimulates peristalsis in the large intestine, and the magnesium draws water to the large intestine. Combined, they propel your gut's contents along. These capsules can be obtained at any health food store with a supplement section; you can get them and magnesium citrate in the same store usually. Be warned, some people report a mild burning sensation both in their esophagus and their rectum (basically like when you eat some really spicy food and it gives you the runs). The regimen I've read that works best is a heaping teaspoon of magnesium citrate in a large glass of water, chased with 1 or 2 Cayenne capsules before bed produces a BM the next morning. Start with a low dose. When you buy the capsules, they'll have a heat rating, usually between 40,000 - 90,000 HU. 


* Request **Lactulose** from your pharmacy. It's basically a sugar that helps with bowel transit. Didn't work for me, but it works for some. 


* **Docusate** is an OTC stool softener that makes me nauseous and does nothing else, but maybe it'll work for you. MagCit beats its brains out.


* **Bisacodyl** is your go-to OTC stimulant laxative. In the US it's known as Dulcolax, but there are off-brand boxes that are cheaper and similarly effective. Use this carefully. It can exhaust the muscles in your intestines, so while you get relief one day, the next two days you're in a refractory period where constipation starts up again. Use 10mg 2x per week if you have insanely bad constipation like me. Don't exceed twice per week. Use 5mg if you're underweight. Safe to use with MagCit. I like using it in the morning on an empty stomach and I'll skip breakfast that day. The more food you have in your digestive tract, the longer it takes. Empty stomach = 2-4 hours, full = 8-12. Long-term use is frowned upon but there's no actual evidence whatsoever that it causes a problem. Read the case studies if you don't believe me.


* **L-Arginine** is an over-the-counter supplement available at health food stores. It is used by athletes to increase cardiovascular health, but it has a magic side effect: diarrhea! Why? Because it breaks down into nitric oxide synthase, which regulates bowel transit time, and researchers recently discovered is [deficient in people with motility disorders](https://bit.ly/2WuGrCV). See [this conversation](https://www.ibsgroup.org/forums/topic/352542-unexpected-cure-slow-transit-colonic-inertia/#entry1449238) for more details. Also, taking this supplement with a small amount of baking soda might increase its effect, according to some athletes who experienced intense diarrhea after doing so (they like baking soda because it reduces acid production / muscle soreness). Oral dosages vary from 2-6 grams but some people go higher. Be careful and talk to your doctor first. L-arginine is also available in suppository form and there is good evidence to believe these are safer and much more effective.


* **Amitiza (lubiprostone, prescription):** Your doctor might prescribe this first. It's an expensive prescription osmotic laxative. It causes nausea in a lot of people and it didn't work for me, but it's a godsend for some. Try it. Take with a great deal of water. DO NOT TAKE AMITIZA WITH LINZESS, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like osmotics).


* **Linzess / (linaclotide, prescription, ""Constella"" in Canada):** This is the most powerful prescription ""osmotic"" (it's actually a Guanylate cyclase-C agonist) in the world, and it will make your ass explode the first time you take it. It comes in strengths of 72mcg (that's micrograms), 145, and 290. I have a lot to say about this medication so read carefully. Also, if you've tried Linzess and it didn't work, please read my [how to make Linzess work guide](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/guide-why-linzess-fails-and-how-to-make-it-work-again/).


First of all, it has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates your nerves) in addition to its osmotic effect. This is a good thing. Amitiza does not have this.


Your digestion is on a schedule. Some of you go every day. Some every other day. Some once a week. Whatever your normal clockwork is, this medication will sometimes work and sometimes not, depending on how much fecal obstruction there is in your intestine on the day. There were times when 290mcg did absolutely nothing for me, and other times 145 made me run wide-eyed to the bathroom fifteen times in thirty minutes. You will figure out how to make this medication work after a lot of trial and error. Don't just dismiss it the moment it doesn't work. 


I'm of the mind that no human being should ever take 290mcg and it has got to cause long-term damage to the intestines, but all my specialists disagree. They prescribe this dose to women quite frequently for some reason. 


Linzess has a penchant for working very well for a few weeks, and then ceasing to work at all. Keep it refrigerated (there's a rumor that it goes bad if it gets warm, but pharmacists will not confirm this). Take it with a large glass of water and stay super hydrated all day. Water is key; it cannot work if you don't drink a ton of water with it. If this medication dehydrates you (it will), grab a bunch of those vitamin/mineral powder packets from the health food store and chug one or two a day. If you get bad headaches/migraines/weak pulse/sweats/nausea, you need to just quit the medication and talk to your doctor. Ask him to reduce the dosage.


Although the prescription for Linzess is once daily, I find it works best for me taken twice per week with another medicine like Motegrity (Prucalopride) or Bisacodyl. I take it on an empty stomach in the morning and don't eat anything until it starts kicking in (which is quite fast...usually under two hours).


LINZESS HAS A [BLACK BOX WARNING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning) against its usage in persons under 18. It is extremely dangerous to children. If you don't hydrate enough on a regular basis, it is also dangerous to you. It is illegal to give it to your kids. **If you don't have a gallbladder, mention this to your doctor before taking Linzess. I once heard that's an issue, but I can't find a source online. DO NOT TAKE LINZESS WITH AMITIZA, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like them).**


* **Motegrity (prucalopride, prescription):** This is a brand new drug, the first in its class, and it's a 5-HT4 agonist. It works similar to some antidepressants, by targeting specific serotonin receptors in your intestines. Except Motegrity is a highly specific agonist, meaning it has a narrower range of side effects and typically won't affect your mood. This drug actually works for me, it worked immediately, it still works. Zero side effects. I take it in the morning on an empty stomach, although it can be taken without regard to food. 


Most doctors in the US don't even know about Motegrity so ask them to look it up. It's brand new, meaning it's expensive. But don't worry. *All* of these drugs are insanely expensive. As far as I can tell it is safe to take with osmotics like Linzess but I have not confirmed this with a doctor. In my reading, I see no relevant contraindications between the two. 


There is a warning in the box that some people committed suicide or experienced suicidal ideation while participating in clinical studies for Motegrity. There is no statistically significant relationship established here, but the company is by law required to make this information public. Frankly, Motegrity has zero side effects on me, and I expect these people killed themselves or thought about it simply because constipation disorders are f*cking horrible and make you depressed.


If you live in the UK, Europe, or Canada, your doctor will know this medication as Resolor or Resotran.


* **Zelnorm/Zelmac (tegaserod, prescription):** This drug is similar to Motegrity (insofar that it is also a 5-HT4 agonist). It is older than Motegrity, and considered less safe because it interacts with receptors in a less specified way; there is some evidence that it interacts with cardiac receptors. In plain English this means it *might* be responsible for causing strokes and heart attacks in some patients. The evidence is debatable. 0.11% of people who used Zelnorm in a study experienced cardiac events, compared to 0.01% who took the placebo. That's 13 out of 11,500 people. The drug is available in the US only to women, although your doctor can order it ""off-prescription"" if he deems you low risk. Basically don't try this drug if you are overweight or have any notable cardiac family history.


* **Trulance (plecanatide, prescription):** This is the main competitor of Linzess (linaclotide) and has a smaller side effect profile. It appears to work pretty well if osmotics work for you, but I haven't tried it. It also has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates the nerves in your intestines). I assume, like Linzess, it is also dangerous to children. Give it a try.


* **Mestinon (pyridostigmine, prescription):** This is where it gets weird. Mestinon is a drug that treats myasthenia gravis, which is a nerve disorder similar to MS. But, it can be used to treat constipation in some cases. It's an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it *increases* your body's levels of acetylcholine. This is a neurotransmitter that is partly responsible for telling your intestines to squeeze. Most doctors will be hesitant to put you on it, but you can give it a try if all else fails. It has a strange side effect profile and causes fainting/blood pressure drops in some people. I never tried it.


An interesting story...there is a woman who did a bit of basement chemistry and figured out that she could spike her acetylcholine levels by literally sticking a nicotine patch on her stomach below the belly button. It caused her bowels to empty after a week of constipation. She then invented [Parasym Plus](https://secure.vagusnervesupport.com/products/parasym-plus%E2%84%A2), a supplement that allegedly does the same thing. I bought this and I cannot figure out if it actually worked. Maybe it did a little.


There are many acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drugs on the market. Prostigmin (neostigmine) is one of them. Ask your doctor if he thinks it's a good idea. He'll say it isn't. But if all else fails...


* **Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate, prescription), or any related SSRI antidepressant:** Antidepressants are now being used to treat constipation. Some clever fellow figured out that the majority of serotonin (the mood-regulating neurotransmitter) is manufactured in your intestine, not your brain, and that antidepressants were giving people diarrhea for some reason. I haven't tried Lexapro but it's next on my list and my doctor likes it because of its small side effect profile relative to other antidepressants. This drug has a wider side effect profile than related constipation meds like Motegrity/Tegaserod, meaning you could have mood swings or drops/spikes in energy, etc.


Despite our overwhelmingly negative public opinion about antidepressants, they are rather safe* and effective for many people. It's just that they're over-prescribed. A low dose does help some people normalize bowel function without causing mood/personality changes.


*edit: A redditor linked me to [this article](https://rxisk.org/bladder-and-bowel-problems-after-antidepressants/) explaining that some SSRIs can cause long-term GI problems. The comments are worth reading. As with all pharmaceutical drugs, you are weighing your current problem versus the potential side effects of its treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks and do your own research. Talk to friends and family members who have taken SSRIs.


* **Erythromycin:** This is an OTC (I believe) antibiotic with a very odd side effect: it speeds up gastric emptying and gut motility. Hooray! The case studies are kind of back and forth on its efficacy for constipation, but some doctors swear by it. The problem is that it's an antibiotic.


Here's the thing about antibiotics. They should not be overused or used unnecessarily. They can *seriously devastate* your gut flora and cause SIBO and worsen your condition. On the other hand, your condition could have already been caused by antibiotics, or by a pathogen that will killed with antibiotics. Proceed with extreme caution.


* **Colchicine:** This is an anti-inflammatory derivative of the autumn crocus plant. In large doses it's highly toxic, but in small doses it's used to treat Gout. However, [a recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19705134) determined that it's an effective treatment for Slow Transit Constipation / Colonic Inertia (basically any constipation disorder that does **not** involve physical blockage like tumors, obstructions, etc). I haven't tried this but my specialist claims it is quite safe in low doses and he would be happy for me to try it out.


* **For those of you who are diagnosed with slow-transit constipation / colonic inertia:** [Here is a master list](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/masterlist-of-remedies-for-colonic-inertia-slow-transit-constipation/) of treatments.


---------


**MY PERSONAL REGIMEN:**


Some of you have asked about my specific medication regimen. After several years of trial and error, I have found regimens that basically make my life normal again. **Please note** how the regimen evolves over time! Intestinal diseases typically are very transient and change over the years. What works for you now might not work in a while:


2012 - 2014: Senna laxative once per week


2016: Bisacodyl and Miralax twice per week


2017: Magnesium citrate 450mg each morning before breakfast


2019: 


* 2mg Motegrity (prucalopride) daily in morning


* 145mcg Linzess (linaclotide) every other day in morning


* 450mg Magnesium citrate before bed


-----------


**EXERCISE**


Of all the treatments I've tried, exercise is near the top on the list of effectiveness. Exercise is a conduit for getting all of that stress and potential energy out of your body and away from your guts.


Get a standing desk at work (a good company will accept a doctor's note and buy one for you). Stand for half the day, intermittently. Go on jogs in the morning and walks in the evening. Get to the gym and get your knees above your waist - stairmaster, yoga, squats, etc. Just MOVE MOVE MOVE. By doing so you are stimulating the vagus nerve and increasing motility. You will literally shake the poop out.


If you live an incredibly sedentary life, you will suffer much more.


---------------------------


**SURGERY FOR EXTREME CASES**


Please visit my updated guide at /r/ConstipationAdvice for new guidance on these surgeries.


* For those of you diagnosed with CI, you might be considered for the [TAR IA surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180598/), (total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis). This is the laproscopic removal of your entire large intestine and the attachment of your small intestine to your rectum. The nice thing about this surgery is that you still get to go to the bathroom normally, except you have mostly diarrhea for the rest of your life (because your large intestine is the thing that turns diarrhea into solid stool by absorbing water).


* The other option is one of many variants of the colectomy (resection or removal of the large intestine) with colostomy or ileostomy. These are both [ostomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine), which is the surgical creation of a hole in your lower abdomen. A medical bag is affixed to that hole, and your small intestine drains into it instead of down into your rectum. This is a much bigger life change, but from the people I've talked to, it's surprisingly not that big a deal.


If you are interested in these surgeries you will have to have a great number of conversations with many doctors and jump through a lot of hoops.


--------------------


**A NOTE FOR WOMEN AND TEENAGERS**


The feedback I get from most **women** is that their (male) doctors are extremely dismissive and incredulous about the woman's constipation issues. Doctors are going to act like you are crazy and hormonal. They're going to tell you to just eat some fiber and take some miralax and bugger off. You have to be strong, confident, and knowledgeable of your situation. Do not take no for an answer. Inform your doctor that you are *past* the standard constipation treatments and this is an ongoing problem that reduces your quality of life and warrants the attention of a specialist.


It helps if you appear to know what you are talking about. Learn about your [digestive anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and understand the difference between your small and large intestine. Understand the [constituent parts of the large intestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine) (ascending, descending, sigmoid, transverse, rectum, etc). This will help you communicate to your doctor more efficiently and it will help you better understand his/her findings. If you show your doctor you've done your homework, it is very likely he/she will take you more seriously.


Everything I just said applies to **teenagers**. The additional problem facing you is that you have an extra gatekeeper: your parents, and the fact that you rely on their insurance. You need to have a level-headed conversation with them about your situation, however embarrassing that may be, and convince them that **they need to be advocates for you, not obstacles to you.** Getting them on your side now will benefit you greatly when the doctor questions the seriousness of your complaint.


----------------------


**A FEW FINAL NOTES**


* Read. You aren't going to effectively communicate or convince your doctor of anything unless you have some introductory knowledge of your body. Learn about your [digestive anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and understand the difference between your small and large intestine. Simply knowing this information will help you come up with questions about what could be causing your issue.


* Save yourself the remarkable headache and get physical and digital copies of the results of every single test you have performed, even simple blood tests. When you inevitably get transferred to a different specialist, having this stack of files will make your life so much easier.


* Your insurance company is going to fight you on some of these medications. Tell your doctor to tell your insurance it is an *urgent medical necessity* that they cover this medication. They will fold. 


* DO NOT GIVE UP. Write down your next steps. Follow up on calls, appointments, etc. I keep lists of all my medical to-do's and I cross them off line-by-line. It gives me a great sense of accomplishment and control over this whole situation.


* Relax and get your mind off your condition. This is hard. But there is absolutely a psychological component to your condition. For some people, it's *entirely* psychological (this is called Chronic Idiopathic Constipation or Functional Constipation). **People who suffered sexual abuse in childhood often develop constipation disorders in adulthood.** Google this and investigate it with your doctor!


I go on long nature walks with my headphones. This is how I unwind. Some people do Ju Jitsu. Some people do music. Spend time with family and engage in your hobbies. This will absolutely help, especially if your condition is idiopathic in nature.


* Intractable constipation is often the result of extreme stress. Have a serious brainstorm about whether you need to quit your high-stress job. Are you in an abusive relationship? GET THE FUCK OUT OF IT. Can you afford a week-long spiritual retreat where you take a vow of silence and eat a vegetarian diet and sit in a garden with a pen and paper? DO IT. Now is the time to try all the weird stuff.


* Cry whenever you have to; don't bottle anything up.


* Talk to other sufferers about it. Reach out and get involved in a community. Support is everything.

1gykp4q,IBS,Crohn's Disease ,"So, I've had a chronic IBS-D diagnosis and have been taking Bentyl for a few years now. It's always kind of bothered me that I also had nausea, but the Bentyl helped with that and I seemed okay, figuring that it was perhaps from having several different food intolerances.

I had upper abdominal pain this morning but it was fairly mild and I thought, ""Maybe I'm getting ulcers. I'll talk to my doctor if it keeps happening."" I decided to go to work because I felt fine otherwise. It kept bothering me all day, so I ate nothing but mild stuff. Towards the end of my shift, it suddenly got *extremely* painful and I was dry heaving and crying from the pain. I went from work to the ER and ended up vomiting there. After a bunch of tests and a CT scan, the doctor said my small intestines is inflamed but nothing else is wrong, and that it typically means something like Crohn's Disease. So, now I'm gonna have to go back to my gastroenterologist and probably get tested all over again.

It is somewhat a relief, though. I got sick of everyone telling me it's just IBS and that ""nothing is wrong"" and ""it's all in your head."" Nice to know I'm not crazy. Not saying people with IBS are, but it's definitely a stigma being diagnosed with essentially ""no idea what's making you sick."" I just wish this was properly diagnosed earlier.

1go8om5,IBS,"Lewis Score 1250. Significant enteritis through small intestine. Possibly IBS ? Looking for alternatives (to Crohn's) to rule out or rule in, before next doctor appointment where biologics may be prescribed.","Symptoms: bloating, gassy, thin stools, loose stools, mushy stools.

(Also skin issues, something like seb derm or psoriasis that comes and goes - waiting for a dermatology appointment for diagnosis. Two different family doctors at the same clinic have given different suggestions - one thinks psoriasis, the other thinks seb derm. Steroids seem to work at reducing the inflammation).


These symptoms can be improved a lot when eating a restricted diet - specifically the quality of the stool. Gluten or at least certain types and quantities, seems to be a reliable trigger of the symptoms - but celiac blood test came back negative.

A colonoscopy was conducted first, they checked the tail end of the small intestine while they were there. Noticed a lot of inflammation and some ulceration. Took a couple biopsies which 'came back clear' (of what, I don't know), but they found this odd so consulted with histology who said to go by the visual indicators and ignore the clear biopsy results.

Booked a capsule endoscopy, which because of a shit public service took 6 months until my appointment.

In the meantime, was prescribed two months course of budesonside - but couldn't handle the psychological side effects so came off that after a few days, asked the family doctor if they could prescribe anything else, but was told I would have to wait for my next gastro outpatient consultation.

Spent this time focusing on diet, and whatever improved stool quality. So, no fast foods, no processed foods, no beverages other than water, drastically limited refined sugar. Big reduction to gluten - namely white breads - though I still ate some cereal (corn flakes) and a slice of wholegrain bread each day, the logic being if it's celiac or gluten related I would want evidence of that in the endoscopy (I didn't know it was going to be a capsule endoscopy until the day of the procedure, so there was no biopsies taken).

Stool quality stayed consistent, and close to normal I would say. Softer than I would like, and maybe 1/3 to 1/2 as thick as I would like. However, stool quality was excellent imo for a period of time when I was eating 200g of Kefir Yoghurt every day (which has a lot of probiotics in it). I had to give that up after about 6 weeks because it turns out it was causing me very bad nasal congestion. Turns out kefir, like other fermented foods, is very high histamine - not to mention being dairy. My take away from this is it was probably the probiotics that were helping. However, when I took probiotic supplements earlier in the year, they didn't help - though that could be down to the rest of my diet not being restricted at the time, or not using the 'right' type of probiotics supplement.


Anyway, about 6 - 7 months after the colonoscopy, and no medicine, I get called in for the endoscopy - which turned out to be a capsule endoscopy. The way the technician spoke on the day, it seemed like the only thing they were interested in diagnosing was Crohn's ... I asked about Celiac, and other alternatives, and she didn't seem interested. I acknowledged you needed a biopsy to diagnose Celiac, but I asked if they would be inspecting the footage for visual indicators or not and it seemed to just go in one ear and out the other. So the sense I got was that they were operating as if Crohn's was a foregone conclusion, and they were just looking for supporting evidence of this.

The results of the capsule endoscopy came back: overall Lewis Score: 1250, which was the same score in the 1st and 2nd tertile, and a score of 350 in the 3rd tertile. Significant Enteritis. About 7 visible ulcers in each tertile.


I just seen a print out of the results that they sent to my GP, but I haven't yet had a consultation with the GI doc (which is tomorrow). But I can see from the printout that they sent my GP that they believe the capsule endoscopy results are in line with their Crohn's suspicions. It says 'Biologic Screen. Discussed and approved.'

Now look, if it's Crohn's it's Crohn's .... But I want to make sure they are ruling out other things first, like (primary) food allergies and intolerances, celiac, a viral or bacterial component to the enteritis, etc. Because they've literally done nothing but write down the symptoms I listed in this thread, and a capsule endoscopy - and they're ready to diagnose Crohn's and put me on biologics. I just want to make sure they're running any other definitive tests they can to rule out or in other conditions that may not require such a heavy duty drug.


So, to that end, I'm looking for ideas, suggestions, advice from the community here on what alternatives (to Crohn's) that I might consider and ask the GI doc to investigate or consider, before settling on a diagnosis.

42 years old, male. Don't drink or smoke, but I did up until i quit when I was about 30. Can't drink now even if I wanted to, I had a few drinks at a BBQ a couple years ago and it seemed to cause a long lasting flare of whatever it is I have ... terrible stool quality for about 3 months afterwards.

Don't have much dairy (other than eggs) in my diet, other than when I tried it thinking it would help the gut. Gluten I never mindfully avoided, but I wasn't a daily consumer (at least as far as I was aware). I became mindful of it before the endoscopy, and maintained a little exposure thinking a biopsy would be taken. But since the capsule endoscopy I have stayed away from it mostly, and whenever I do experiment with it - by eating baguette - my stool quality will suffer significantly for sure. Nasal congestion and skin quality have issues to begin with, so reactions there are harder to trace to a specific food.

Diet seems to have big consequences on stool quality, but that could be because of (primary) allergies or intolerances, or it simply be because of acquired sensitivities owing to the enteritis caused by X, Y, Z.

Something told me that if it's IBS I would have some form of relief with the meds they give yet it had no affect whatsoever that's when I went to a specialist and boy oh boy I have so much more worse things going on I'm not going to get too into it because it's a long list of illnesses. My main problem was my stomach hurting all the time and no proper BM for more then a year. 
I got tested for liver , kidney and spleen function among other tests and basically my organs were busy failing and this caused my stomach to hurt so much. I'm on medication now for the last 2 weeks and I have seen a MASSIVE change. I can walk again and don't stress about my stomach hurting Everytime I eat or stand up. I don't know if this will help, but I wanted to share with you guys that if you feel something else is wrong trust your gut Litteraly. Now I have normal BM and I honestly In shock that doctors didn't pick this up earlier. Never let others make you feel like you're crazy or that's it's nothing because it is if you can't live a normal life.

13s89c7,IBS,Seeking Advice: Recommendations for Fiber Supplements to Alleviate Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms?,"Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I've been experiencing a flare-up of my Ulcerative Colitis and have been prescribed Prednisolone for the past two weeks. Initially, I started with eight tablets a day, and now I have reduced it to six tablets a day as per my doctor's instructions.

Despite the medication, I'm still facing urgent and explosive diarrhea shortly after eating. I'm wondering if anyone could kindly suggest any fiber supplements that have helped them in bulking up stools? However, I would prefer recommendations that don't contain prebiotics or probiotics, as I recently tried probiotics and unfortunately experienced worsened symptoms.

I‚Äôm 21 and dealing with what seems to be anxiety-triggered IBS-D, and honestly, it‚Äôs starting to affect my daily life and confidence.

Most of the time, my gut acts up when I‚Äôm nervous or anxious like during exams, important events, or even social situations. I‚Äôll feel fine, then suddenly get:
Completely watery diarrhea
Urgency and sweating
Sometimes multiple loose stools in one go
Occasionally, just unformed stool but it still ruins the day

The weird part?
When I‚Äôm calm or at home with no stress I can eat almost anything (including gluten, red meat, lentils, fried food), and I feel totally fine. It‚Äôs like my gut only reacts when my brain does.

Recently, these flares have become more frequent, and it‚Äôs starting to feel like I have to ‚Äúplan my life‚Äù around the bathroom. Weddings, travel, even college stuff feels hard.

I‚Äôm just wondering 
Is there anyone else dealing with this exact pattern?
How do you manage anxiety-related flares?
Any success with lifestyle changes, therapy, or specific foods?

Really appreciate any tips or just knowing I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.

1fyj6i5,IBS,The link between IBS and anxiety is vastly underestimated,"**Hey, first post here! I should mention that I'm a (male) hypochondriac, and I find health just as interesting as it is terrifying. This post isn't going to talk about diet and medication, as I'm sure everyone knows and has tried everything in that regard. Buckle up; this might be long.**  
  
 **(TL;DR at the end).**

**Experience:** I've suffered from functional intestinal disorders (IBS) for over three years now. None of my doctors thought it was a good idea to do any exams in my case (I can't blame them), but neither of them ever considered anxiety as a cause of these problems. You will see anxiety mentioned everywhere, but nowhere does it say it might be the root of IBS. I've read so many articles and watched so many YouTube videos that I've begun to connect the dots, so I thought I'd give an AI (a trendy thing to do apparently) dozens of articles about IBS. Of course, I tried as much as possible not to influence the AI towards anxiety (as human factors can easily alter the results), and every single time, anxiety came back on top as the main cause. Obviously, that doesn't mean anxiety is the only source of IBS; it is multifactorial, and each of us has very different gut sensitivities. But resolving anxiety problems can greatly reduce symptoms.

**Anxiety:** Would you describe yourself as an anxious person? ""No"" was my first answer to this, and it's probably the same for you. Because anxiety can be very sneaky, you can live with it without ever noticing it. A few symptoms you might recognize:

* Muscle pain/tension
* Digestive issues (duh)
* Rumination/negative anticipation
* Difficulty concentrating (sorry, it's not ADHD)
* Irritability
* Avoiding social situations
* Procrastination
* Sleep disturbances
* Difficulty recalling recent information (what did you eat for lunch yesterday?)
* Mood swings/loss of pleasure
* Nervousness (fidgeting with hands, chewing on objects, nail-biting, repeatedly moving legs)
* Weight gain/loss (comfort eating or loss of appetite)
* Dependency (alcohol, tobacco, medication...) 

To name a few...

If you have ever noticed improvement in your symptoms while on holiday, for example, this might be a good indication that anxiety is a problem for you.

**Link between IBS and anxiety:** The link between anxiety and IBS stems from the gut-brain axis, where psychological stress influences digestive function. Anxiety disrupts communication between the brain and the gut, altering gut motility and immune responses. This disruption amplifies the body‚Äôs stress response, contributing to IBS flare-ups. Anxiety can also heighten the body's sensitivity to gut sensations, leading to a more intense perception of discomfort. This relationship creates a feedback loop, as anxiety worsens IBS, while IBS fuels further anxiety.

**Other conditions it may trigger:**

* Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) / Chronic Prostatitis (CP): I put this one at the top because doing pelvic floor exercises can greatly improve bowel movements, as crafting a good stool is key in IBS; this is often underestimated as well.
* Bladder Pain Syndrome (Interstitial Cystitis): Due to visceral hypersensitivity, this will cause urinary problems and discomfort.
* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Stress can increase acid reflux and worsen heartburn symptoms.
* Functional Dyspepsia: Upper digestive discomfort, bloating, and early satiety.
* Fibromyalgia: Often co-occurs with IBS, involving widespread pain and fatigue influenced by stress.

**Ok, so I might have anxiety. How do I deal with it?** Take a deep breath‚Äîyes, seriously. Simply doing breathing exercises can already help you manage anxiety. The psyche is very complex; there are things we think about consciously and unconsciously. The good news for us is that things we do consciously can affect the unconscious, which is where anxiety often lies.

**Physical activity:** Even if you despise sports, its effects on your body are quite magical. Your body will always reward you and try as much as it can to make you feel good about it. Think of it as a challenge if that helps. I can't stress enough how important physical activity is for your body; seriously, go for a run (if you can).

**Cognitive therapy:** Talking about your problems with someone can already help. You might identify underlying traumas you never thought you had and work on them (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ""EMDR"" seems to be very good for that).

**Sleeping:** Yup, don't underestimate a good sleep schedule. Try going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time every morning (ideally sleeping early and waking up early too).

**Social support:** Talk about it! Do your coworkers know about your poop? Well, they should! Try and seek support from people around you. If they know what you‚Äôre living with, they might actually help you get better.

**Get out of your comfort zone/routine:** When was the last time you went hiking? Or went for a walk in that park you used to like so much? (Go easy with this one; some people tend to find routine more reassuring).

Our body is physiologically the same today as it was thousands of years ago, yet our lifestyle is drastically different from what our body was created for. We did not evolve to survive in the comfort of an ergonomic chair behind a computer; this might create an unconscious dissonance.

**Conclusion:** While we all have different bodies and different sensitivities, especially in the gut, we all function quite similarly. Whether you have a microbiota imbalance, gluten intolerance, or inflammation, what may exacerbate your symptoms might be something you were never aware of. Trying to reduce your stress levels can only be beneficial for your gut health and health in general, whether mental or physical. So please, try to take care of yourself.

Hope this post helps some people.

**TL;DR 1:** Anxiety seems to be widely underestimated by the medical field and people in general for IBS. Trying to reduce stress levels has been proven to greatly reduce IBS-related symptoms. In this post, I give ways to recognize anxiety if you don't really feel anxious, and ways to overcome anxiety.

To fix your anxiety the best remedy I found is to do anything other than worry, I‚Äôve been to the doctors twice and they couldn‚Äôt find anything. I didn‚Äôt really believe it at first, but I realised my anxiety was the key factor.

1. hang out with friends CONSTANTLY this will take all focus off worrying about your symptoms and ibs.

2.watch tv, read books, video games these all took away from my symptoms helping my mind relax.

3. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for everyone but smoking weed may help if your into that it calmed my mental state and eased everything it‚Äôs not for everyone but if you already do it and stopped then try again it may just help you out.

If you have extreme anxiety and ibs then what I‚Äôm trying to say is that it‚Äôs not the food or your lifestyle or stress or whatever that‚Äôs causing your IBS symptoms it‚Äôs your anxiety it will make it excruciating and put you in a constant loop of worry I thought I had appendicitis the pain was so bad but friends that also had ibs and anxiety assured me they had that too before working on a treatment, be assured I do not have appendicitis I‚Äôve been checked over many times and I‚Äôve had nothing.

I‚Äôd like to share my experience and ask for input from anyone who went through something similar:

About 4 months ago, I had a major panic attack at night. The doctor said my physical health was okay. But after that, I experienced indigestion, appetite loss, anxiety, mild depression, sleep disturbance, and tingling in my left hand and sometimes under my chest (left or right side).

I also started having constant death-related intrusive thoughts and anxiety. Later, a mild lower abdominal inflammation was found. The doctor prescribed antidepressants, but I stopped because they affected my energy. Instead, I went with natural remedies: chamomile, honey, balanced eating, and keeping myself busy. I got much better, but occasionally I feel fatigue, tension after meals, and can literally hear my heartbeat below the belly button, with colon discomfort.

1jhanpl,IBS,My belly problems caused a panic attack,"As the title says... I'm typing this with red eyes from crying. This morning had to take my oldest child to practice and needed to run a few errands with my youngest. 

While at Walmart started having the familiar pain of an episode and my anxiety kicked in which made it worse. Went to the bathroom in the back of the store and they were closed for cleaning but I knew I couldn't make it to the front bathrooms.

So I sat on the bench impatiently waiting for them to be done. I was literally panicking but tried so hard to hold it in because I didn't want my 10 yr old to worry. Finally they were clean and I ran in. 

After going the pain subsided temporarily but then hit me again while loading the groceries in the car. On my way back through town I ran into detour signs and f***! Our town is having a St. Patrick's Day Parade! I had forgotten all about it. 

So of course my mind starts to go crazy which intensifies the pain and next thing I know I'm in traffic squeezing every muscle from my stomach down as tight as possible. I started hyperventilating and crying. I called my husband and asked if he could get the oldest from track (he does) but by the time I make it to my house I'm sweating.

1kodfgr,IBS,Finally got (semi) confirmation that my IBS was anxiety and stress-induced.,"I was hesitant to tag this as a ""success story"" since it's caused me so much unnecessary pain and suffering over the years, but I recently got (sort of) confirmation that my symptoms were anxiety-induced.

After tracking my food for around a year, I noticed that I couldn't fully nail down a consistent pattern with flare-ups and pain. After colonoscopy, endoscopy, ultrasound, and MRI yielded no results or root causes, I recent did a food sensitivity test, and results revealed that I had pretty much no existing food sensitivities in any category.

Imo, this explains the lack of consistent pattern and repeated agonizing flare-ups I was getting multiple times a week (sometimes multiple times a day) even when I was eating low-fodmap, avoiding milk, avoiding fried/spicy/ultra-processed food, etc.

I also noticed that anytime I had a drink, even if it was just a single small drink, all my symptoms would magically vanish, even if I'd been having chronic non-stop agitation in the hours leading up to the drink. And it didn't matter what I was eating if I had alcohol in my system, it's like the alcohol made me immune from a flare, regardless of food choice.

It took a few years of testing to get to this point, but I can focus less on pinpointing foods and more on treating the underlying anxiety/chronic stress/PTSD symptoms that's keeping me locked in this cycle.

Edit: I know alcohol is a gut irritant, and it's not a healthy long-term solution, and I only drink sparingly at this point, but I mention it because of the effect it had on making my symptoms dissipate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kodfgr/finally_got_semi_confirmation_that_my_ibs_was/,1747433727.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1kpp9th,IBS,The act of eating in and of itself is easily the biggest most consistent stress in my life,"I have SUCH anxiety towards food. Anything. Literally anything. 

My IBS is so awful because the same food that doesn‚Äôt trigger me 3 times in a row will suddenly trigger me the 4th time. My IBS makes zero sense. 

Every single piece of food I eat, I get anxiety. Sometimes it‚Äôs subconscious. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôm nervous‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm always nervous. 

Food in and of itself makes me incredibly uncomfortable. 

I never venture out to try new foods. I stick to the same foods and have for years. I stick to what‚Äôs safe because my IBS can be sooooo nauseating and painful. 

I won‚Äôt eat at anyone‚Äôs house because I‚Äôm terrified. 
I won‚Äôt eat on vacation unless I‚Äôm in the hotel room. 
I won‚Äôt eat anytime I‚Äôm not home except for like a granola bar or an apple (because my IBS flares up something awful if I leave me stomach empty for too long). 

I stress anytime I have to eat, even if it‚Äôs the same thing I have every day. It STILL scares me. Because you just never know. 

When I eat something and I DONT get a flare up, I‚Äôm shocked. 

When I eat something and DO get a flare up, I‚Äôm never surprised. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter what the food is either. 

I can have a McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburger and French fries one day and be fine. 
But then another day I can have a healthy fresh salad with non acidic dressing and I‚Äôll get so sick. 

My IBS is SO unpredictable. 

Does anyone share this super unhealthy relationship with food like me? Is anyone else literally afraid every time their stomach grumbles because you‚Äôre hungry and you know it‚Äôs time to eat?

Just looking for people to relate to me. everyone on my husbands side of the family thinks I‚Äôm weird and rude because I won‚Äôt eat when they‚Äôre around. 

The fact is I won‚Äôt eat when any guests are present. I only eat when I‚Äôm with my husband or alone because I don‚Äôt trust my stomach.

1lk8dld,IBS,Tired of hearing ‚Äòit‚Äôs just stress‚Äô ‚Äî anyone else not buying it?‚Äù,"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôve been dealing with gut issues since I was a kid‚Äîmainly morning cramps and urgent BMs, usually soft or diarrhea, especially after breakfast. Coffee and stress could sometimes trigger it, but it wasn‚Äôt super frequent back then.

Now it‚Äôs happening every day. I wake up, eat breakfast, and immediately need to rush to the bathroom. I usually go 3‚Äì4 times, starting soft/yellow and getting progressively looser, with pretty bad cramps that last for a couple of hours. After that, I‚Äôm usually fine for the rest of the day.

I‚Äôve done a lot of tests‚Äînormal pancreas (elastase), normal bloodwork, no celiac, no lactose intolerance. Stool tests showed fat and some undigested food. But my doctor barely went through it and just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs IBS from stress‚Äù and prescribed amitriptyline. I explained that this happens even when I‚Äôm not stressed, like on vacations or completely calm days, but he just kept pushing the ‚Äúit‚Äôs unconscious stress‚Äù explanation and didn‚Äôt really dig deeper.

I left feeling pretty dismissed. I get that IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, but it‚Äôs frustrating when it feels like they stop investigating and just label it as stress when they don't know what else to say.

Has anyone else had this experience? How did you find a doctor who actually listened or took your symptoms seriously? Would love to hear if anyone found something helpful that wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúmanage your stress.‚Äù

By the way, I'm taking imodium and it helps a bit. Metamucil makes my symptoms worse, i think it makes me poop more.

Thanks so much!

I have had every gastro test going, cameras up and down, scans, camera pills etc.  All comes back as 'just' IBS and functional dyspepsia. My gastro has kind of given up on me now (I am in the UK so under the broken NHS).

  
The older that I am getting, the worse everything is getting.  It is not helped at all by the stress of caring for elderly parents one who has dementia, and going through menopause myself.

I bloat, have horrible gas and have this urgency feeling which is truly stopping me from living a normal life.  I live in constant fear of crapping myself.

No amount of meditation, gut directed hypnotherapy, breath work, following a low fodmap diet, avoiding my triggers and only drinking water helps right now.  I take loperamide when things are bad but too much and I end up constipated and as soon as I stop I am back to diarrhoea or frequent loose stool.

  
I tried Nortriptyline a few years ago and I think it started to help but then I read it can contribute to dementia and that scared me as my mum has Alzheimer's disease but in all honesty I am seriously thinking of trying it again because I literally have no life right now,  I can hardly eat for fear of triggering my gastro colic reflex.  My family life with my husband and kids is ruined because I never want to go anywhere for fear of needing the toilet or soiling myself.  I really think I need to take the Nortriptyline again.

I would say I'm probably IBS-mixed but with a tendency for diarrhoea at times.

Itvswops and changes. During the whole of January I had daily diarrhoea and managed to get back to a normal poop by taking daily peppermint capsules. However, I will often pass these 'normal' poop (no.4 on Bristol stool chart) but will go several times a day (usually twice in the morning and again in afternoon or evening) and often feel the need to go all day. 

I suffer from nausea, acid, pain in my stomach, bloating burping, gas (especially in the evening) and this feeling of pressure in/on my rectal area needing a poop all the time. 

I have tried everything suggested for IBS management including still being low fodmap and avoiding my triggers. My gastro no longer wants to help as all tests normal.

18qz2v7,IBS,"Improvements from anhedonia, depression, brainfog so far","I have been in a living hell for the whole of 2023 and on a rollercoaster with my health for years..  
I just wanted to share some positivity and hope in my journey so far as I am relieved to be having more days where I am just feeling like myself. My symptoms were digestive sure, but I've also been greatly affected by the mood and cognitive symptoms which prevent me from living my life.  


As of the last few weeks I've seen major improvements. I am still recovering. I still experience bloating, diahrea, and food triggers which cause me to plummet into having a weaker brain in darkness but here are the improvements:  
\- Recovering from food triggers showing milestones after 3 days, as opposed to 7-10 days AND baseline is much better  
\- Clarity of mind improved; presence/dissipation of dissociation, focus is sharp and I've returned to work being able to multitask, and self manage. The feelings of total dementia and stuffy head from severe neuro-inflammation are long gone.  
\- I can drink coffee and it feels like I'm drinking coffee (at my worst anything mind altering was futile, my brain axis was so damaged nothing worked- I am still sober from all else)  
\- Depression and severe anhedonia is absent when I'm at a baseline; have begun to feel more than relief that is like being dried by the lovely sun after being pulled out from drowning in the tumultuous sea but also re-experiencing the natural interest in socializing and love. Enthusiasm for life is returning and I am looking forward to my life and all the things I'm looking forward to doing. Friends say they can see the difference in my energy and eyes  
\- Abilities day to day thus improving as I am able to do more than survive on more days, achieving more and repairing my life which died, and I am rebuilding a new one  
\- Skin health has improved (used to be so bad my hands would crack and greasiness was severe  
\- Hair falling out less  


  
What am I doing? Nothing particularly outstanding to be honest. I have been on a very strict lifestyle for the past nearly 3 months and finally getting some bigger results. The following is what my naturopath has advised thus far based on my personal\* test results (check w your functional practitioner before starting). The following is my DAILY protocol:  
\- anti-inflammatory diet with as much fibre from wholefoods as possible   
\- exercise (cycling, running, walking) although running still triggers hip pain since last year  
\- glutamine and product containing aloe vera/boswellia/larch daily (1 hour away from food)  
\- zeolite at the end of the day after the first 1-3 hours of fasting for the night (I only do about 10-12 hrs... my focus is on eating when I need to, but separating 3 meals to let my gut rest)  
\- 3 types of probiotics with a few overlaps (amounting to 90 billion, which according to some research isn't necessary but I'm not f\*cking around)  
\- methylated b vitamins  
\- vitamin D liquid  
\- zinc  
\- glutathione  
\- curcumin and saffron capsule  
\- saccromices boulardi  
\- 1 litre of green tea  
\- products containing iodine, selenium, magnesium and other vitamins  
\- enzymes when needed after meals later in day   


Starting work has been incredibly difficult but somehow I made it and the fact I have begun to have that to hold on to has been super helpful in my process (achievement, connection, stability, purpose).  


  
Anyways, good luck to everyone on their healing journey. I would never give up but it felt like this would nearly kill me. Keep going, here is hope!

1kb31xc,IBS,Considering giving up and accepting this as my reality.,"Hi everyone thanks for being here! This post is quite honesty longer than my patience and I apologize for that.  I (30F) have been half ass advocating for my chronic constipation since about 2020 when I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 25 and started seeking help for my alcoholism and eating disorders. I have dealt with constipation since I was a child, que traumatic memories of getting suppositories because we didnt go to the doctor. When I was old enough to manage my own bathroom habits, I was having type 1 or 2 movements maybe once a week until this last year I was having no movement without laxative intervention.

\-October 2024 I suddenly started having type 7-like straight brown water- 10+ times a day. I was quickly able to do multiple stool test to rule out infection (Shiga, C-Diff, Giardia, Cryptosporid, Salmonella, E coli, etc.) all negative. I had a referral in to a GI in June of 2024 to finally address my chronic constipation but my primary warned me it would be an uphill battle getting help bc most GI docs would see my history of drinking and¬† eating disorders and chalk everything up to that-which I was prepared to fight against, so that appt was coming up at the beginning of January 2025 but was now seeking answers for the crippling diarrhea which I had literally never experienced before in my life.

\-(1/6/25) ¬†My first GI appt we did some blood work-all normal, and an x-ray to make sure there was no impactions-there wasn‚Äôt. Her first thought was SIBO, the test showed I was methane positive and was treated with a round of Rifaximin and Neomcin. This did not change any of my symptoms, I was still painfully bloating the second I ate or drank anything and no changes in my 10+ liquid shits a day. The GI also referred me to pelvic floor PT, I completed 6 sessions with no measurable progress due to the diarrhea.

\-(2/10/25) I then had a colonoscopy with a 3 day extended prep, this was clear expect hemorrhoids and somehow stool still in my colon-this seemed like an important piece but it was chalked up to me not doing prep well which was not the case. I struggled to start eating anything after prep because I hadn‚Äôt physically felt that good in a long time even with intense prep.

\-(3/20/25) My next visit she said it was probably just IBS to which I asked ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that just a blanket diagnosis when you don‚Äôt know what is causing my issues?‚Äù, she didn‚Äôt appreciate that but I‚Äôm long past being pleasant. After that visit she ordered an ultrasound to check my gallbladder because of my constant back pain and ordered an enzyme stool test. In the meantime I started Amitriptyline to see if it will end up helping long term, and short term I started on the drink packet Chloestyramine/Questran 1 3x daily with meals, I took that for 4 days with no significant improvement besides I was somehow constipated and having diarrhea and it was causing me extreme back pain so she told me to stop those as they should have already worked if they were going to.

\-April 2^(nd) my ultrasound came back clear but the enzyme test showed an elastase level of 192 so I started Pancrelipase 1 pill 3x daily with meals. She then ordered a CT with contrast of my abdomen to see my pancreas better-everything was normal. I took the enzymes in various amounts after my initial few days because it wasn‚Äôt making a difference, I took them for about 2 weeks with continued bloating, pencil thin stools multiple times a day with no relief or feeling like I‚Äôve full emptied my bowels, even if I take MiraLAX. My follow up keeps getting rescheduled and I‚Äôm debating even going back. I am waiting for a referral to the hospital that I do all my regular doctoring though for a second opinion.

At the beginning of all of this I started on low FODMAP but it didn‚Äôt matter being that strict so I loosely follow it still, quit all carbonated drinks, 1-2 cups of coffee now, much better water intake, gluten free, dairy free, safe foods are cheerios, oatmeal ‚Äì I can add a small amount of frozen fruit or an egg with it, occasionally a GF protein bar, and luckily Gatorade and glucose tablets (I‚Äòm guess it‚Äôs due to the small quantity) to manage low blood sugar. I have somehow not lost any weight, if anything it feels as though I‚Äôve gained despite D and pretty significant restriction. I take quite a high dose of Magnesium Complex in addition to Lyrica 150mg 3x daily to help with my neuropathy, Spironolactone 50mg for skin help with no improvement, insulin, vitamin D3, and Amitriptyline 30mg. I do work with a dietician but she specializes more in eating disorders combined with diabetes so she‚Äôs been at a loss besides just encouraging me to eat what I can. I work part time, online college full time, I have a lot of external stressors but they are all out of my control. I walk everywhere so I do have plenty of movement. My depression and anxiety are the worst they‚Äôve been in a long time- I do go to therapy and have a great team though. I‚Äôve been sober for over 2 years and things literally have only gotten worse medically. ¬†I‚Äôve considered adding in a few supplements but what‚Äôs the point if my body isn‚Äôt absorbing them? I was also diagnosed with Hashimoto's in the beginning of 2024 and its now somehow resolved itself??? I took Synthroid for about 9 months up until october when the D started, we checked my thyroid function and it was low now. Feb 2025 it was still lower end of normal. 

This thread and learning how to use reddit has been so beneficial to me as I learn literally everything I can about how to just fucking feel even a little bit better and know there are people there who understand the struggle. I just feel at a loss right now as to what I should do. I feel like I‚Äôm making up all my problems at this point and wasting everyone‚Äôs time. Does this sound similar to anyone else‚Äôs journey or is there anything else to consider to ask about?

1lgxqf2,IBS,Ignored by multiple doctors‚Ä¶I‚Äôm about to give up. Do your symptoms match mine? What were you diagnosed with?,"So for 4 years I've been having my symptoms. It all started after I dealt with the worst fever of my life. I started having Thin, loose, sticky, mushy, dark stools. I have to go like ~5-10 mins after eating, and no matter what I eat it's mostly always the same stool. They're not pale, watery or whatever. If I don't go, it's extremely uncomfortable and painful. It wakes me up at night if I don't empty my bowels before sleep. Hot and/or spicy foods do make it kinda worse though. 

Physically it's awful, I have really bad, general muscle weakness, fatigue, hair loss, shortness of breath, dryness, some vision problems, headaches. Bones bend easily, I have delayed healing. 

Mentally and cognitively, I have bad anxiety, stress, inability to focus, memory disturbances, slowed thinking, brain fog and lots of behavioural changes. 

Now obviously, because of my symptoms, I suspected malabsorption and booked an appointment. My gastro ordered TSH, celiac test, calprotectin test, and hepatitis. 

All came back normal so he told me malabsorption is ruled out, you just need to be more physically active and improve your diet like bruh. He did give me some probiotics, B12 tablet and some other tablets none of which made a difference. The other gastroenterologist gave me Imodium which didn't have any effect. 

I've done a CBC which showed low lymphocytes (1240) and slightly elevated hematocrit and haemoglobin. LFT showed slightly elevated total bilirubin and elevated ALT, GGT and albumin. 
Other than that I've tested for vitamin D twice in 2 years, came deficient both times, got treated both times but nothing changed. 
I've recently done a B12 test which came 377, low-normal, and iron and ferritin came normal. That's pretty much it. I haven't done homocysteine to confrim functional deficiency. 

I don't have a SIBO breath test or seHCAT available in my country. Literally don't know what should be my next move, this is really affecting my life and studies. 

 If anyone can match their case with mine, I'd really appreciate it

1crlste,IBS,Caffeine was the rootcause of my IBS-D,"I want to share my story about my struggle with IBS-D for the past 20 years. My symptoms included chronic fatigue, memory loss, difficulty focusing, needing to sleep after eating, diarrhea, and intestinal pain. In the past, I used to drink a lot of coffee, which made me very tired and caused me to lie on my bed every afternoon. I switched to tea, which made me feel slightly better, so I thought I could continue drinking it. Later, I switched to green tea, but in the long term, it made my symptoms worse. I want to emphasize that today, I can guarantee that ALL green teas made my condition worse. Green tea can really be bad. (I am not talking about ginger tea or thymus tea).

Eventually, I stopped consuming all foods and beverages that contain caffeine: tea, coffee, chocolate, soda (redbull, coke). By the way even the smallest caffeine intakes are bad.

**Improvements**

Since then, I've noticed a significant improvement in my symptoms. I have more energy, I can focus on my work, and my memory has improved. I'm less tired during the day, and I no longer need to sleep after eating. I don't have so many diarrheas.

**Long lasting effect of caffeine on the intestine**

However, I realized that caffeine had a long-lasting effect on my intestine, and it's been very slow to recover. To speed up the recovery process, I've found some natural allies, such as odorless garlic softgels, natural peppermint softgels, raspberry ketones, licorice roots, and apple cider vinegar.

**Long recovery:**

I think it will take me around three years to fully recover. It took me a long time to understand the effects of caffeine on my body because, after I stopped consuming it, it took 10 months before I noticed any improvement. In the past, when I stopped drinking tea, I thought it didn't make any difference. But now I know that I just needed to be patient and give my body time to heal.

**Recovery depending on age:**  
The improvements come with slower bowel movements. It takes very long before witnessing an improvement. People in the same situation than me can see an improvement in a year if they are in their twenties or thirties. I tell you so because in the past I already stopped caffeine and started again but since changes were very long to come, I could not identify the rootcause of my problem. Now, I know it but i am 46 years old and I understood it will take much longer than before to recover from this problem.

**Decaf:**  
In the past, I attempted to switch to decaf coffee. However, I continued to experience abdominal discomfort after drinking it. As a result, I stopped consuming decaf coffee altogether. It was then that I discovered that decaf coffee still contained caffeine. Nevertheless, if you are ever in a situation where you have to choose between tea, green tea, coffee, or decaf, the latter is the best option since it contains the smallest amount of caffeine. In fact, decaf has even less caffeine than green tea.

Update:  
I am also under the impression that my dental hygiene was a problem. my dentist found i had tartar under my teeth, micro organisms with direct access to my blood. I have decided to go for a deep cleansing of my teeth. it is a long process. I think this helped too.

1k1909w,IBS,Bowel anxiety turns into panic disorder,"29f in Aus, became very unwell 5-6 years ago after traveling through the Middle East where I got an illness that couldn‚Äôt be diagnosed but was somewhere between meningitis and typhoid and chronic gastrointestinal problems. I had a very traumatic time starting with vomiting and diarrhoea for 6 days non stop while over seas and flying, then on and off diarrhoea for a month after the trip then the fevers of 38-40 deg for 3 weeks, memory loss, pain weakness, then some sort of systemic skin problem where my eyes swelled shut and my skin was insanely itchy for months and months - seemed like topical steroid withdrawal type thing but didn‚Äôt match much else. I was still going to the toilet 9+ times a day for at least 12 months.
Since then everything has improved gradually over 2-3 years except energy. I now have a new problem, when I think about going to the toilet or how my stomach feels I get flash backs of the times I had felt so sick and helpless and it gives me anxiety, so much so that it upsets my stomach - when I have something important on I worry my tummy will get upset and then the worry makes it upset even though there is no reason for it. There are times when it‚Äôs not so bad and then times when I‚Äôll be so anxious about going to the toilet I will stay home for days even though my bowels are basically normal. 
My question is, does anyone take anything for anxiety for things like presentations or important meetings that might make me a little anxious? 
I want to stop the body response from small normal anxiety that can lead to my stomach getting upset and then I have a proper panic on my hands! I often take Imodium and that totally removes all anxiety but I would love to try the anxiety medication instead because 9 times out of 10 there is nothing wrong with my bowel movement I‚Äôm just traumatised by it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1k1909w/bowel_anxiety_turns_into_panic_disorder/,1744883818.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1jqypae,IBS,When to get a second opinion?,"I am going to summarize quickly what I am experiencing then move onto what my current specialist is doing. I am a 26F experiencing unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite, enteritis across my intestines, my duodenum pre steroids was friable, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and currently my jejunum has two amphtae ulcers. I sought treatment through GP after losing weight and the fall of 2024 was referred to a GI.

GI has done a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and multiple ct scans. I was given the budesonide steroid for 12 weeks. As soon as I was off it, I saw regression. I was just put back on it two weeks ago.

Mid February, I had a capsule endoscopy that showed my two amphtae ulcers in the jejunum. So, my doctor scheduled a single balloon enteroscopy.

I get the balloon enteroscopy. My fianc√© went with me. He was in the waiting room the whole time and they said they would grab him when I woke up. Apparently, I woke up and had a whole conversation with my doctor that I have no memory of and they never got him. My jejunum was too swollen and the scope ended up just looping in my stomach. But, on one document they said specimens were collected but one they didn't. My doctor later confirmed on the phone that they did not. This was mid March.


HERE IS THE MAIN ISSUE

They refer me to a different GI for his opinion and to see if I need a double balloon enteroscopy. They put my phone number down wrong so when I called they said they meant to call me. Then, they said I cannot get scheduled with this doctor as I do not have ulcerative colitis. I don't know what to do now. I call and leave a message for my main GI that they said they could not take me and asking if I should schedule with a different provider in his clinic. This is now like 3/20. 

I never receive a call from either GI at this point. I call again to the different GI. They tell me that my doctor had put in a referral that said small bowel, then two more with one being a capsule endoscopy. This is like 3/27 now. I just had one, and that's not what they discussed with me. The person on the phone was helpful. I end up scheduling with a random provider at the Dr's office that my GI said I had to go to for the double balloon. 

I call my original GI to update them on the situation. They only have voicemail set up when you do the extension to talk to a nurse or in clinic staff, no one has ever picked up. I leave a voicemail explaining.

It is now 4/2 and I still have had zero contact with my original GI. I left two voicemails on like 3/20 and 3/27. I still don't know what to do. I am in pain with ulcers, undiagnosed, and getting worse as the days go on with no help and no one to talk to. Please help me doctors of reddit, is this normal?

# TL/DR: How Probiotics Destroyed My Health
Taking certain strains of probiotics years ago gave me severe health problems, when before I was perfectly healthy. My body initially reacted to them as if I caught a severe stomach bug. After taking them, I got diarrhea, nausea, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, nerve pain, severe chronic belching, chronic mal-digestion of foods, constant sore throat etc. It continued to progress to the point of panic attacks, having zero appetite, and having severe flu like symptoms all the time. I did a antibiotic regiment and recovered in less than a week, being able to eat anything and everything without any problems besides feeling completely amazing. I then took a different probiotic with different strains and my body got just as sick from it. I was never able to truly recover after that point. Antibiotics helped again temporarily but stopped working. Without severe intervention on my part, my body slips quickly into misery, and I basically go insane. Medical tests are inconclusive and my gastroenterologist thinks its my immune system overreacting and I agree. 

I think I‚Äôm a 1 in a million case where taking certain probiotics shifted the bacteria in my gut to a point where my immune/nervous system is in a constant state of reaction. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that the bacteria are bad necessarily, it‚Äôs how my immunity reacts to whatever is going on in my microbiome. The only things that provide me relief are antibiotics (which eventually stop working completely.), and osmotic laxatives.

### Inducing osmotic diarrhea using Magnesium is the only thing that keeps me functional. Otherwise, I'd be crippled, bedridden, or dead.

# There is a fairly complex back story to all of this...
To get the full picture of what led up to now and how I‚Äôm almost certain probiotics are what have led to my problems, you will have to read the whole 8,000 word timeline below. There were 2 stages to my sickness from probiotic. The 1st stage started in 2015, which wasn‚Äôt so severe. I had issues but never felt like I was dying. My body was able to maintain some sort of homeostasis. The 2nd stage started In 2017 and it got very severe from a different probiotic incident. I'm basically hopeless now.

I started working on this autobiography in early 2019 and just now finished it. I threw this TL/DR together at the last minute. The main purpose of this is to find people who‚Äôve had similar reactions, to help those who may not know probiotics are making them sick, and for myself to keep a timeline of events. 

Part 2 is linked at bottom of post.

Symptoms directly below before main story

# List of Symptoms:
#
‚Ä¢ Constipation 

‚Ä¢ Muscle twitches

‚Ä¢ Pencil thin/loose/Undigested/Yellow-Orange stool

‚Ä¢ Nausea

‚Ä¢ Intestinal soreness

^(Mainly in the descending colon.)

‚Ä¢ Reflux/Asthma 

‚Ä¢ Fatigue/Intolerance to Physical Activity

‚Ä¢ Brain Fog

‚Ä¢ Tinnitis

‚Ä¢ Soar Throat/Flu Bug like feeling

‚Ä¢ Chronic Belching
 
^(Was significantly worse from 2015-2017. I could burp constantly for hours on end, 1,000's upon 1,000's of times per day. It has got somewhat better since 2017 when all my other symptoms got worse from the severe probiotic incident. It's like the burping was a physical coping mechanism by my body for dealing with the ingestion of the ""probiotics"". It's since been replaced by an anxious/fear response emanating from my gut. It's not attached to any particular thought or action. Instead of the urge to constantly burp in my gut, it manifests as a feeling of ""wrongness"",  along with an excitation of all my other listed symptoms. It's like the nerves in my gut are being fried.)

#### All the bullet points below didn't start until 2017 with severe symptoms induced by Probiotics.

# To preface this I am a 24 year old male... My occupation is being a part time Rural Carrier at USPS. 
#
# I enjoyed perfect health up until the age of 18. I sewed the seeds for my destruction shortly before I turned 17 when I began taking minocycline for some moderate acne. At the time, my doctor also prescribed me a plain L. Acidophilus probiotic to take with the antibiotic. 
This probiotic along with yogurt made from L. Acidophilus, S. Thermophilus, and L. Bulgarius are the only strains I can say do not effect me negatively. The antibiotic didn‚Äôt cause any problems at first either. If anything my bowels became healthier, more formed and darker, but weren't really bad to begin with. 

Things went on normally for the next year or so health wise  until I started developing breathing problems shortly before I turned 18 in the late Summer of 2014. I also was having some other related problems like continuingly having to clear my throat and hack up mucous constantly which was made much worse by eating any kind of dairy.  We eventually found out months later it was silent acid reflux being caused by taking the antibiotic everyday for over a year. I was reacting to the medication and it caused my guts to become very sensitive. 

Of course at the time I didn't know this, so it was doctor visit after doctor visit being prescribed everything from thyroid medication, various inhalers for the asthma, PPIs for the reflux, and even prednisone at one point. I think at the high point I was on 8 or 9 medications at once. At the end of the day I always had symptoms to one degree or another. I also had been taking minocycline this whole time along with the other medications. One day around February of 2015 or so I realized that maybe it was the medications causing my problems so I just threw them all in the trash. I was done just like that. Within a couple of weeks, I had returned to being virtually 100% healthy. All my previous symptoms pretty much disappeared. I was performing very well for the first couple of track meets my senior year of high school, better than I ever had before. 

# Within few weeks of stopping the medication, the return of homeostasis I experienced vanished. All of this happened after I started to go on a ""health kick"" in April of 2015... which involved taking various supplements, including a powerful multi-strain probiotic to try and keep myself ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.
I started having symptoms I'd never had before. Very loose yellow/orange stool with undigested food, extreme chronic belching, brain fog, and bad fatigue. It got so bad so quickly that within about 3 or 4 weeks of that I dropped out of track. I got it in my head that I was having some sort of relapse from my prior months of sickness, even though the symptoms were different, much more severe, and came on very suddenly. After destroying the rest of my high school graduating year of 2015, I was still left with trying to figure out what was happening for the next 6 months. It had it's ups and downs when trying to pinpoint the causal problem but I never found the answer. I just thought my guts were f'd from the past antibiotic and medication usage. Throughout this time I had the extreme chronic belching (would literally burp 1,000 ‚Äì 10,000 times a day almost every day), pretty bad bowel issues (loose stool that would a lot of the time be undigested and pencil thin), very low energy/fatigue at times, and cold like symptoms (sore throat, hot/cold flashes, chills, etc.) All of these would usually be somewhat relieved by a bowel movement. I never thought to even look at the supplements I was taking as a cause of my symptoms.  

# One day in Nov of 2015, I went to my doctor... and I told him pretty much everything that was going on and the different stuff I was taking. He told me just to stop all of the supplements I was taking and see what happens. 
I did and within a week,  for the first time since all of this crap started in my body earlier that year, I achieved a  relatively strong state of homeostasis and peace again. It wasn't perfect but it was there. I‚Äôd say 70% or so of my issues disappeared. I realized it was something I was taking that was causing my problems and I narrowed it down to potentially being the probiotics. It was a powerful multi-strain one I bought off of Amazon and the start of my symptoms correlated with receiving them in April of that year. I chalked it up to being more the brand of probiotics, rather than the specific strains in it. I avoided probiotics for the next 6 months or so and during that time I felt good enough to go out and get my own apartment as well as my 2nd job (now only job) as a part time mailman. 

# I tried a different brand of probiotics which I ordered on March 13th of 2016 called Prescript Assist...
because my gut symptoms had never fully resolved, even after stopping all supplements. I kept reading online about how good probiotics are supposed to be for your gut and hoped they might fix me. This time it was a soiled based probiotic called Prescript Assist and it gave me the EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS (yellow loose stool, fatigue, etc) I previously experienced. After a few days of this I recognized what was happening and stopped them completely and recovered for the most part. I realized I had these two brands of probiotics that both caused me serious bowel problems. I then had the idea that probiotics were likely what caused all of my problems in early 2015. This time, instead of trying a probiotic, I thought I‚Äôd try something that works as an antibiotic. 

# On April 9th of 2016 I ordered some oregano oil off of Amazon and it pretty much cured me...
When I received it I took a few drops in water 3 times a day with food for about a week. I don‚Äôt remember exactly when I started feeling better when taking it, but I know within a few days it brought me back to virtually 100% percent health wise. My bowels were perfect and my energy levels soared through the roof! I hadn‚Äôt felt that good since 2014. When I stopped it, I relapsed to some degree but not very much. I was able to eat many foods that once would cause me distress such as fruits and other very carby/starchy foods without fatigue or bowel issues for the most part. I still didn‚Äôt learn my lesson with probiotics though. I thought fermented foods might be beneficial, and to some degree, they were. I started regularly buying Kombucha from store and drank that. I cannot say that it specifically gave me severe problems. But, I do know that when I was at my heaviest drinking it, my bowels would be very loose and unsettled sometimes. I don‚Äôt think the CFUs in the Kombucha were high enough to really throw anything off severely. Shortly after my Kombucha phase, I tried another form of fermented drink, this time Kefir.

# I ordered Kefir grains off of Amazon on July 15th 2016...
and made it with milk. Honestly I don‚Äôt think it really affected me that negatively at first for the first 3 months or so. My bowels actually seemed to improve or at least didn‚Äôt get worse from the new baseline I achieved. Around fall of that year things started to go a little crazy again. I started reacting to the Kefir. My Bowels still weren‚Äôt near as bad as they were before, and we‚Äôre actually pretty normal for the most part, but I started getting a lot of mental symptoms. I became hyper emotional a lot of the time either feeling extremely happy, extremely sad, or very irritable/irrational. I could get so angry and freak out over basically nothing. Soon after that, I‚Äôd start to go on near psychotic breaks at times. This was probably mid-late October of 2016. I would just get the sense of overwhelming uncomfortability internally, I just couldn‚Äôt sit still and be calm. I could kind of feel it coming from my guts. It wasn‚Äôt really pain or cramping, just the sense of ‚Äúwrongness‚Äù inside. It would permeate through my gut and radiate into my body. When I would get these ‚Äúanxiety attacks‚Äù, I would usually go on long drives until they calmed down, or to somewhere where I could freak out alone. Often times I would just be balling most of the time and freaking out while grabbing/massaging my stomach and or hitting it with my fist. Eventually it would reach a point where my guts would kind of feel like they cramp up and I‚Äôd have a bought of excessive belching sometimes as well. Shortly after that I‚Äôd have a bowel movement and that would relieve a lot of the mental/anxiety symptoms and I‚Äôd be okay again. Even when those attacks were happening, my body still had a certain physical feeling of strength to it and I could feel that the attacks would pass. I just had to let my body go through the motions. I eventually figured out during periods when I‚Äôd drink lots of kefir, my body would have these attacks, along with the cramping like sensation in my stomach. I stopped and within a week or so the crazy emotional/mental symptoms and physical sensations stopped. I felt much calmer then the previous couple months and returned to feeling mostly normal with lingering symptoms. 

# Things balanced out again after stopping the kefir but barely just. This was in November of 2016. 
I continued searching on for a better state of wellbeing. Roughly around Feb of 2017 I achieved a state that was probably 96% ‚Äì 97% of my normal and back to eating everything without any side effects but feeling amazing. The Interesting thing is probiotics partially contributed to my recovery, or at least so I believe. 

# Sometime around mid January of 2017 I began experimenting with the SCD diet...
I didn‚Äôt really notice much difference at first but, when I added in spices like garlic and cayenne that seemed to really help, I believe because of the antibacterial properties just like the oregano helped. One of the steps of the SCD diet was to eventually add in ‚ÄúSCD yogurt‚Äù. It is essentially 24 hour fermented milk with the cultures L. Acidophilus, L. Bulgarius, and S. Thermophilus. The idea behind the 24 hour fermenting time is to get the most cultures as possible. Up to almost a billion a cup. 

# It was an early morning in February 2017 when I had my first cup of homemade yogurt, shortly after eating breakfast right before work. Within 12 hours or so I could not believe the positive changes my body went through after eating that one cup of yogurt. 

The upward spiral of symptoms that occurred throughout the day of work were nothing short of miraculous. Not all of this will be exact because I‚Äôm doing it from memory. It started in the morning I was just crushingly weak (I was struggling just lifting mail and moving packages around) and was having weird nerve pains in my legs/buttocks area. However, I still felt a sense of underlying wellness even with these symptoms. As the next few hours passed, I started to feel quite a bit better in the weakness department, but slowly throughout the day I developed thee most persistent excessive belching I‚Äôve ever had. The burps I was letting out were insanely voluminous, I could not burp fast enough. With this gas accompanied something else I‚Äôd never experienced, bad bloating. It was so bad I had to loosen my belt a couple notches. I had never done that before ever that I can remember. I never really had or have had bloating regardless. Throughout this day my feeling of wellbeing slowly kept going up, emotionally and physically. It eventually reached a peak at the end of the work day where I just felt like a completely different person. I felt like I was touched by the hand God honestly. The emotional and physical wellbeing radiating from me was something I had not experienced to that degree in a long time. I would say the feeling was very similar when taking the oregano oil about a year earlier. My bowels/guts/mental state felt so good, and all the symptoms I‚Äôd been experiencing earlier in the day vanished. When I got home I felt a strong urge to defecate. Not diarrhea or anything, just a normal healthy urge. I went and it was perfectly formed and dark brown in color. Something else I had not experienced since I tried the oregano oil in 2016. My stool was usually a light tan rather than dark brown and not near as well formed. I continued to eat the yogurt a couple times a day afterward and it continued to make me feel amazing for a few days. I think I was eating too much because I started to get a lot of anxiety and similar symptoms to when I was overdoing/drinking the Kefir so I stopped. 

After I stopped, my symptoms remained much improved, but relapsed a bit. My stool stayed dark brown and much more formed than before. However, they would alternate between pencil thin and we‚Äôll formed. I would be having 3 bowel movements a day consistently too when before it was generally one a day or one every other day. My mental state returned to being much improved as well after stopping the yogurt.  The last step in returning me to perfect health at that time was removing reverse osmosis water from my diet that I‚Äôd been drinking for the last year. I went to normal tap water/spring water that actually had electrolytes in it. For whatever reason that seemed to kick my gut into overdrive. I had another couple days of some weird symptoms but then I made a virtual 100% recovery. I went back to having 2,3,4 perfect dark brown formed bowel movements a day and feeling absolutely fantastic, emotionally and physically, no matter what I ate. There was no more alternating pencil thin to formed stools and my energy increased even more. The only symptom I really had left was the chronic belching to a slight degree. I would only burp a couple hundred times a day at most, but otherwise felt amazing. Why all of this worked in returning me to a healthy state I‚Äôm not 100% sure. In hindsight, I believe it was a combination of the things I was doing  that initiated the immune response that sent me into healing. The combination of the spices, the yogurt, and switching to tap water gave my body the right trifecta to get itself mostly back on track.

Here I was in a mildly confused state. I recognized how much the probiotics in the SCD Yogurt contributed to my recovery and helped return my bowels to normal, So I thought maybe I just needed to stick to simple probiotics. I had some plain L. Acidophilus left (Floragen brand) that I started taking when I started the SCD diet before the Yogurt. I continued that for a week or so until it ran out. Everything was fine and I continued to feel fantastic. Once I ran out of the plain Floragen, I figured I‚Äôd continue with a simple probiotic. 

# I bought a single strain L. Plantarum probiotic by GoodBelly from Amazon on February 10th, 2017. It wrecked me and brought me to rock bottom. 

I didn‚Äôt start it till the end of februaryish beginning of March because I was using up the Floragen first. Even though this probiotic was a simple one lactobacillus strain, it wrecked me. 

***My newfound homeostasis shattered into a million pieces.*** Within a week of starting it, I had the same symptoms from the other probiotics that caused me problems, except things kept progressing much worse than before. The most notable initial symptoms were swollen lymph nodes in my groin area and throat, pain in the right side of my groin that radiated into my testicals through my buttocks area and down my right leg, loose undigested yellow stool that progressed into very mucousy diarrhea (something I never had before), nausea with dry heaving, frequent urination/burning pee, Hypersensitivity to loud noise, annoying muscle twitches randomly all over my body, and bad brain fog. I honestly thought I got food poisoning or something because of how bad my body was reacting. I couldn‚Äôt believe that the probiotic alone was making me feel that horrible. I quickly switched back to the Floragen acidophilus just to be safe, but the damage was already done. They helped a little but things didn‚Äôt return to normal and I slowly kept getting worse. I started getting bad carbohydrate cravings, the mucousy diarrhea continued which then progressed into constipation, and I slowly got weaker and weaker. My gut just kind of began to feel dead. They felt so toxic and my bowels would feel like they wanted to have diarrhea all the time if that makes sense but they were just too disrupted to do anything at all. My core homeostasis felt like it had been ruptured and things were going very wrong. I felt messed up in the past but my body never felt broken like it did now. 

# It came to a head on 4/21/17 when I had my first ever panic attack...  
But this wasn‚Äôt a normal panic attack. I wasn‚Äôt emotionally compromised or anything like that. My fight or flight response would kick in regardless of whether I wanted it to or not. My nervous system/gut/hormone axis was being severely affected by my broken gut. My body was in serious disarray and was trying to compensate. The panic would only get severe when I would lay parallel or close to parallel to the ground. When I would lay down, my heart would start pounding out of my chest immediately and the urge to inhale deeply and rapidly would take over me and make me instantly sit-up in bed. I literally could not keep myself laying down. As soon as I would sit up, the palpitations and shear panic would cease and digress into more of a strong anxiety like feeling. Every time I‚Äôd lay down, It felt like I was waking up from a nightmare. That‚Äôs when I knew my body was in serious trouble. This wasn‚Äôt just fatigue and bowel issues anymore, this was a whole new level of agony. It got a bit better as the night went on and I maybe got a half an hour of sleep. [Here is a snippet of a phone call I made to my Mom after this panic attack happend. (Made with a phone call app I'd been using for awhile that passively records phone calls)](https://www.reddit.com/user/HealthLogs/comments/s7l5fa/first_panic_attack_phone_call_042117/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I went to work the next day and delivered my mail route hoping it was just a fluke. I got home, ate, all the normal evening activities and hoped it would just kind of go away. NOPE. As soon as I got ready for bed and went to lay down, it happened again. The shear adrenaline pumping panic returned within seconds of laying down. 

At that point I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I had a B Vitamin Complex in my cabinet that I use to take and it would always really relax me and make me feel really good in the past so I decided to try them and they worked. They were very high dose, in the 1,000's of percent. Within an hour or so of taking them my body shifted from the anxiety/panic to feeling very relaxed and calm. My gut and body were finally experiencing calm and homeostasis. My bowels also went back to being somewhat formed. It felt like the vitamins were forcing my body/bowels to stay functional, giving it the hormonal and nervous system output it needed to temporarily compensate for the internal turmoil that was going on. It wasn‚Äôt actually fixing anything, just masking it. I still had the anxiety, still had the fatigue, and my bowels were still not right despite them being more formed. If I missed a day of the B vitamins, the diarrhea would return and I could feel my body very quickly slipping back into agony. They also became less and less effective overtime and made my body more sensitive negatively in other ways. My body was put in overdrive from the b vitamins to avoid complete agony. But I could slowly feel myself burning out. 

About a month later, I realized things were not going to get better on their own. After self analyzing my symptoms, I decided I must have some sort of bacterial problem after suffering for a couple of months with the above symptoms. I still hadn‚Äôt made the hard connection that certain probiotics were causing all of my symptoms based off of how much the SCD Yogurt and L. Acidophilus seemed to help me. I still thought maybe I got bad food poisoning or something else like diet. But the connections were starting to come together. Also note I tried the SCD yogurt again during this time. It helped slightly but nothing significant. My next move was to try some antibacterials again and this time I hit them hard. 

# I ordered an herbal antibacterial remedy from amazon on May 8th 2017 and combined with heavily herbed food, cured my gut issues 100%. 
It was called intestine pro intestine support by Teraputics. It consisted of various antibacterial spices and herbs. I got some raw garlic, granulated garlic, oregano, and cayenne pepper from Walmart to heavily dose my food with in tandem to intestine pro to make a combined antibacterial bomb. I also took Floragen a plain L. Acidophilus supplement as well, since it seemed to help in the past and I knew I didn‚Äôt react badly to it. 

I started the regimen somewhere around May 10th, 2017 (again these dates aren‚Äôt exact as I go partially by memory and partially by the dates of my amazon orders and archived email correspondence). I made my evening meal and loaded it with spices. I chopped up several cloves of raw garlic and added them in. I also sprinkled on the spices VERY generously. Using about ¬Ω a bottle of the oregano, garlic, and cayenne on my meal which consisted of some sort of steamed vegetables mixed with beef as that was basically all I was eating when my guts went crazy. I took the ‚ÄúIntestine Pro‚Äù as well with the meal. Shortly after eating I began to feel very hot and relaxed. I then crashed into a super deep sleep. I woke up several hours later drenched in sweat, feeling very hot, felt like I'd been hit by a bus,  but with a sense of deep wellbeing returning. I fell asleep again until I had to get up to work in the morning feeling a little better than my usual horrible feeling, but not great by any means. Still very weak and sick like, I traveled to the Post Office I was helping out at. At some point in the morning I had to go to the bathroom. I remember having diarrhea, but it wasn‚Äôt the horrible undigested diarrhea I became used to. it looked much healthier. The diarrhea was digested and darker in color. For the next day or two I continued to do the spices with my food, Floragen and take the ‚ÄúIntestine Pro‚Äù product 2 pills, 3 times a day. During these couple days I would have varying symptoms of what I‚Äôd already had. Hot sweats, cold shivers, nausea, fatigue,  boughts of extreme belching, strong feeling of internal wellbeing that would come and go and contrast with bouts of severe anxiety. I also had diarrhea maybe one or two more times. 

On the 3rd or 4th day of this regimen, I was working in the same Post Office the day after I started the antibacterial regimen. I remember that while I was working there for the first couple of hours in the morning, I felt absolutely horrible. Extremely weak and emotionally unbalanced. I was so weak I had to take breaks between lifting mail into the case and stood there and just cried for a minute or two having severe suicidal thoughts because I felt so bad. I thought I was going to have to go home because of how bad I felt. I kept toughing it out and within an hour or so I felt the strong urge to have a bowel movement. I went to the bathroom and had an almost perfect movement. It wasn‚Äôt super dark but was well formed and was covered in a reddish/pink mucous. After this bowel movement it felt like the sickness left my body and an overwhelming wave of relief overcame me. Over the next couple of days I still had some symptoms but continued to feel better and better to the point of reaching 99+%. I could eat whatever I wanted and felt fantastic. Perfect bowel movements, energy, emotional stability, and of 100% competent ability no matter what I ate.

# My perfect health lasted a couple of weeks until I bought a different variation of Floragen probiotic called Floragen 3...
after the regular floragen ran out. One capsule of Floragen 3 contained 7.5 billion of L. Acidophilus, 6.0 billion B. Lactis, and 1.5 billion B. Longum. My thought process was something like this - ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs floragen brand, it can‚Äôt harm me‚Äù. After taking this probiotic for a few days, I once again wrecked my gut. My gut reacted very similarly to how it reacted to the L. Plantarum and other probiotics in the past. The homeostasis I achieved shattered and I ruined my gut again. All my symptoms returned.

# This is when I really started making the hard connection that probiotics were what gave me my chronic health issues at the beginning of 2015...
and at every such point I had taken them since, besides certain strains. I finally realized the integral role they played in destroying my health. It was hard up until this point to make the clear distinction of what was causing my problems. In hindsight things are much more clear but all of these events are months apart and had multivarying factors that I struggled to piece together at the time. Plus, up until 2017, my symptoms weren‚Äôt near as bad and I didn‚Äôt have to be so strict with my management regiment to keep myself on my feet, even though I was still having issues.

After taking the floragen 3 I finally began to learn my lesson. I started to piece together when I felt bad, when I felt good, what caused my bowel issues and it correlated with taking probiotics. I realized it wasn‚Äôt me being on the antibiotics that caused my true destruction, it was the probiotics.

##### I don't know exactly what happens when I take the Probiotics I disagree with, but it seems as my body completely rejects them and acts like they're a foreign invader. Then from the resulting purge my body goes through, homeostasis fails and results in certain bacteria that my body disagrees with taking hold. The bacteria may not even be directly related to the Probiotic, but comes about indirectly as a result of the immune system purge. This could also be the result of a compounding process. I messed my gut up too many times with probiotics and that now has resulted in my immune system becoming confused or sensitized in some way...

11qnfyw,MentalHealthSupport,just here to vent,"
(TW - depression, anxiety, hallucinations, etc.)

Im 18 yo f. 
So I started getting professional mental health help last year when (I think I have been suffering with mental health problems since middle school basically very long time ago) I was also diagnosed with crohn's disease (IBD). At first the mental help was a psychologist? Basically I only got to talk but never got any pills. It took almost a year for me to get an appointment at and actual therapist (that could prescribe me pills) this was highly and I mean highly recommended by my psychologist. But from where I am from these things take actual ages... I was at the therapist once and she ""diagnosed"" me with depression and anxiety disorder so far. I am waiting to get more appointments where I can actually be prescribed and further diagnosed. I was getting better at some point I'd like to belive but it's just all coming back it's too overwhelming. Besides I am off school because of my chronic disease (school from home only this year because I am at the worse stages still and taking hard medication every few hours) I am expected to make it this year and I've only just started getting grades (whooping 3 grades) and there is only  3 months left. Lately I've been getting more and more anxious and had a severe panic attack last night which included delusions hallucinations and just anything bad you can think off. It lasted about 3+ hours before I contacted a friend. They were able to somewhat calm me down but I'm not ok at all. I get smaller panic attacks throughout the day and paranoia and am scared to try and sleep since that happened last night so I am having anxiety about having anxiety. If you are thinking ""get professional help"" I am litterary trying but it takes ages when I do look for it...thank you for reading <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/11qnfyw/just_here_to_vent/,1678745179.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1jd8du2,MentalHealthSupport,When does poor mental and physical health symptoms an excuse or a reason?,"Lately I‚Äôve been very overwhelmed by everything . Managing my life schedule , new job, new country , health, trying to be disciplined so I can be successful , posting more often on social media to have more followers and make more money and open a business one day so that I can afford to spend on my wellness things and be less tressed by being to afford services that make my life easier. 

Is this all just an excuse for being ‚Äúweak‚Äù and affected . I know it‚Äôs not true but I also wonder if it‚Äôs true because my parents do this , and other online motivational gurus just say that being affected by your mental and physical symptoms and being behind is just an excuse and basically imply you‚Äôre a loser or wrong to give in or just rest and adress it ‚Ä¶. 

And these are chronic . My brain gets rlly overwhelmed and anxious trying to do things that are really outside my comfort zone or give me intense anxiety . 

Like making a doctors appointment in a hospital in a country I‚Äôve just moved to - Dubai. The hospital seems suspicious . 

I‚Äôm  not even sure if the insurance has coverage , overwhelmed to check . 

I‚Äôve been procrastinating calling up and asking and Making a doctors appointment. Because I‚Äôm terrified .  Not even sure if doctors here will believe me or let me check the multiple things I suspect and want to check like parasites . Lyme / ticks etc , sleep apnea . And referral to physio . 

I have chronic pain / tension that moves around , makes my body so stiff and stuck, and weak at times . mild hypermobility in some joints , IBS, Crohn‚Äôs , anxiety , reflux , lots of food intolerances , fatigue , and feeling depressed from it all. 

And not even sure if the physio / other practioner will work or just end up me spending a lot of money for disappointment . And medical and wellness here is extremely expensive compared to Australia or Singapore. 

I‚Äôve been trying to manage everything in my head and it‚Äôs not executing properly . I can‚Äôt even get the basics of sleep early  and eating and journal , meditate , qigong , which I‚Äôm supposed to do everyday and wanting to do some art / creative and post stuff to socials 

I also just started a new job in this country . And it‚Äôs an internship and I need to find a new job after 6 months . 

And I‚Äôm also stressed about that and improving my design skills . 

I am so tired and exhausted from late sleep , lack of sleep , anxiety , pain, poor circulation and not much exercise lately because I‚Äôm so tired 

I just want to rest . Yet I think it‚Äôs an excuse and I‚Äôm not allowed because I didn‚Äôt do the things I said I will do and doomscrolling for hours instead 

If I give in and just focus on my health how am I supposed to even succeed and get over this ? How will I ever get wealth . If I keep on derailing my progress and having trouble managing my life since years now . 

It‚Äôs driving me crazy . I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and it‚Äôs making me freeze and depressed and I just don‚Äôt want to do anything because no energy  and losing interest.

1galsog,MentalHealthSupport,I feel like I am losing my ability to keep on going. ,"I 41f have struggled with my mental health since I was like 17. At 22 I was diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs disease.  Was really sick for years it took its toll. I have since then been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and major depression. I have been hospitalized multiple times mostly for medication adjustments and I OD‚Äôed on anxiety medication 2x. I am cutter even though I haven‚Äôt in last year but it is getting harder and harder not too. I also have severe fibromyalgia which doesn‚Äôt help me. 

My husband (51m) and I have been having some struggles lately mostly him not happy with me. Honestly too much to really get into but anyways.   
He came down the a cold I got and has been flipping his lid on me on and off all day. 

I have been struggling a lot last few months. Have tried a few new meds with bad reactions. My last hospitalization was just shy 3 years ago. 

I am struggling not to fall back to cutting it is a promise I made my husband but honestly don‚Äôt know why I keep this since he is so damn mean to me lately. Why should I care if he is hurt that I broke a promise about something that really doesn‚Äôt affect him in any way. When he can‚Äôt stop calling me names and down right nasty to me. 

Honestly the only reason I haven‚Äôt taken a bottle full of my meds. Is because I know what my death would do to my mom. She is honestly the reason why I don‚Äôt I know it would destroy her. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to go forward in anyway right now.

1f35qmq,MentalHealthSupport,why does self improvement make me overwhelmed and hopeless and anxious. How can I overcome this? I am so frustrated and annoyed and angry at this,"I'm a 23-year-old recent graduate searching for a graphic design job and feeling overwhelmed by all the areas I want to improve‚Äîdesign, illustration, photography, and more. I also want to make money, travel, and address my health issues, but I worry I'm not progressing fast enough. Procrastination and fear overload me, leaving me unsure whether to push myself harder or relax.



When I try to relax, I feel guilty for not doing enough, as my health limits my productivity. Lowering my standards feels like falling behind, but my unresolved health issues‚Äîanxiety, IBS, chronic pain, Crohn's‚Äîcomplicate things further. I stopped obsessing over them because it became overwhelming, but I also stopped seeking effective treatments, which hinders progress.



Seeing others succeed makes me fear starting or being perceived as a failure, even though I know it's not true. My thoughts conflict between what I ""shouldn't"" feel and my persistent negative feelings. Positive thinking offers only temporary relief, and I'm unsure if affirmations are merely suppressing my emotions. I struggle to feel happy or grateful amidst ongoing unresolved issues.



My mind constantly shifts from one task to another, leaving me relieved but never proud, caught in a cycle of stress. I fear that relaxing might make me a failure, yet the effort feels tormenting and frustrating. I question if I'm improving emotionally or just masking my true feelings.



I think I'm failing at self-improvement, as it doesn't seem to motivate or uplift me. I feel guilty for not meeting my standards, and lowering them feels lazy. I often base my self-worth on achievements and others' opinions, relying on external validation for confidence and fearing being wrong.



I'm unsure how to find self-worth beyond my actions and achievements. My therapist suggested that my problem-solving focus might be a distraction from deeper feelings. I still feel anxious, uneasy, and unsafe, wondering if my emotions have multiple layers or if I'm avoiding subconscious issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1f35qmq/why_does_self_improvement_make_me_overwhelmed_and/,1724836927.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1c9y1f9,MentalHealthSupport,I don‚Äôt know if I made the right decision ,"I don‚Äôt know if I made the right decision

So I recently got diagnosed at age 19 with autism, adhd
That makes me have;
Cleft lip
Cleft pallet
Cleft throat
Cleft nose
Crohn‚Äôs
Hyper metabolism
Electrolyte deficiency 
Anemia
Craniofacial muscular issues
Deaf
And more

It was also discovered that my body‚Äî specifically my brain and upper body‚Äî didn‚Äôt properly undergoe puberty

This means I never properly developed emotional sensors and that my muscular growth was stunted 

This was likely caused by;
My mothers abuse
My constant surgeries and medical issues
And environmental stress

So my psychiatrist and neurologist worked together to give me a set of 3 options;
A at home medicinal solution 
A long lasting stay at a psychiatric hospital for study and care
Or
Do nothing and just do therapy and hope things got better

I chose;
A at home medicinal solution
I took a week to make my decision‚Ä¶ and it wasn‚Äôt made lightly but I‚Äôm experiencing a lot of negative side effects‚Äî although perfectly normal and expected ones my doctors assure me

But I feel like I made the wrong choice cause it feels like I took the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù choice out


The side effects im experiencing  are;
Su
Stuttering or lisping
Muscle spasms
Headache
Nausea
Frequent urination
And
Not feeling like yourself‚Äî depressed,anxiety, etc


I feel like I should‚Äôve taken the psychiatric choice cause over the last few days I‚Äôve felt like a huge burden on everyone around me and all I‚Äôve done is cry as I feel new emotion after new emotion (only 2 new ones‚Ä¶ joy‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve been laughing a lot so amused?)
And I just kinda want to know what others would‚Äôve done and what I can do differently to not feel like such a burden given that I right now I can‚Äôt even find a job cause of legal issues with my mother which I won‚Äôt get into

yqch6f,MentalHealthSupport,Everyone Around Me is Dying - But All I Feel is Nothing,"(Blanket Trigger Warning: suicide, loss, gore, etc.)----

In the past five years, around 10 people in my immediate circle of family and friends have died. Five of them were suicides (give or take the two that were potentially murdered...)

&#x200B;

1. My uncle had a secret lifelong addiction to (prescribed) opies. Tried to quit, but couldn't make it. He crawled into the tub in his apartment and shot himself at the peak of his WDs.
2. A friend from college had to have part of his bowel removed from intense Crohn's disease. He hung himself when the painkillers ran out.
3. My best friend went to the grocery store, bought a bunch of groceries. Walked into an alleyway and then abruptly fired 4 rounds - with the fourth going under his chin. At some point a homeless person must have found his body and stole his wallet and cellphone....at least, that's the official story according to the police. Bullshit.I found out he was missing while I was out of the city with my grandpa and uncle. I was in the middle of cleaning up a small cabin they owned near a lake after my alcoholic dad and his girlfriend had a big fight and beat the living shit out of each other.The next day I started calling hospitals... then morgues. That's how we found him. The coroner told me where his body was found, so I went there.It had been raining, but a pool of his blood was still on the ground next to shell casings. I collected quite a bit of evidence and interviewed the people who checked him out. Found video footage. When I gave it to the police they said, ""What do you expect us to do with this?"" to which I replied, ""Your fucking jobs"" - and then the threatened to arrest me.There was a private viewing at the morgue before the cremation. There were maybe six of us there. I still remember watching his mother cry over his corpse. His eyes were still open, pointing in different directions. The entry wound was under the right side of his chin... but he was left handed. You do the math. His father, wracked with grief, asked me to write a book about him. He died a year later himself from colon cancer.
4. About a month later, another friend in the same circle drank himself to death. There's more sketchy shit here too that makes me think he was likely poisoned, but that's another story.
5. One year later my father committed suicide by tucking a rifle under his chin. He and his girlfriend had gotten into another fight, and she called the cops. He did a stint back in the 00s for possession, and he always said ""I'll kill myself before I go back."" Turns out he was serious. I requested a copy of the 911 call... you can hear his voice break when he realizes she called the cops and he just says *""Why? Why would you do that? I won't go back. Now I have to die. You killed me.""*My grandfather was deep in dementia - but when he got the news it was instant clarity. I've never seen anything like it - and I hope I never do again. He kept asking if my dad had used the rifle he had given him (he had.) We lied... but he knew. He just kept saying ""I shouldn't have given him that gun."" Then he would forget what happened - and then **remember.** Over. and. over.My uncle and I decided it wouldn't be right to hire a ""cleaning crew"" for the house. So we did it ourselves. A .30-06 rifle has enough velocity to punch through steel...at close range it basically just makes things explode. We picked up literal pieces of his memories for three days, and buried them next to the bird feeder where he liked to watch the birds.The kicker is, we ended up having to turn the house over the bank anyway.
6. Two months later the same grandpa went into the hospital for a UTI. One night they said he got ""agitated"" and sedated him with motherfucking Seroquel (black labelled for geriatric patients, not supposed to be given)... His mouth got so dry he choked to death on his own spittle in my grandmother's arms.
7. Around this time we found out my wife's father had a rare disease and needed a bone marrow transplant. They found a donor quickly - and he ran marathons and shit, so his heart was strong. Docs gave him an 70% chance of survival. The day he started chemo to kill his immune system (so the new bone marrow wouldn't be rejected) - COVID was just hitting the US. He got it.The badass hung on for a month after - and the transplant worked! His immune system was fighting off the virus, but then he had multiple massive strokes. They took him off the ventilator and he lived for *two full days*.He was more of a father to me than my own father with this alcoholic absence... I have a tremendous amount of guilt admitting that.There was no funeral - only quarantine. My wife's job wouldn't let her take time off since she had visited him so much in the hospital after he took a turn for the worse.
8. One of my uncles was an alcoholic - and the pandemic made it worse. The docs said he needed to quit drinking to live, and instead he chose death - as much as an addict chooses anything, I suppose.His liver failed him about 6 months after my father in law died. He knew the end was close, and started calling family more often. I talked to him quite a few times - but I ignored the very last call. I was just busy. I texted him ""I'll call you back"" but never got the chance.
9. My wife's grandma died from COVID shorty after that.
10. Like my FIL had been more of a father to me than my own, my grandma  was more of a mother to me than my own. My real mother is a complete conspiracy theory/religious nut. But that's a whole other trunk of trauma...Anyway, she had a fall last spring. Fractured pelvis. Some pain, but was walking around fine. We started alternating staying with her - keep in mind this woman was *not retired* at 87, and still drove everywhere. Sharp as a tack. But the doctors ordered strict bedrest, and she became depressed. Stopped eating. She went downhill fast - just lost the will to live. Her hospital stay is another saga (They didn't turn on a suction catheter and her skin literally sloughed off in inch deep  from urine burns.)My last surviving uncle was convinced she would pull through, and wouldn't give her the hospice morphine. I understand... but it made me so mad. We fought, and he agreed to give her some - and then she promptly died. I know he silently blames me, but I don't really give a fuck.
11. Just this past week, my other grandma - deep in dementia, much deeper than the other grandpa - and completely bedridden - she finally died too. This one was almost merciful. It was long past her time, but my mother did everything she could to keep her alive, for religious reasons.She had been in and out of the hospital for the past three years - got COVID and *survived* it - in spite of my mom poisoning her with the ""ivermectin cure."" Every time she went in, I would think ""Ok, this has to be it.""She finally did pass - **on my birthday.** We did have a kind of special relationship, so I'm trying to frame it positively, as a sing of our bond or something - but I know it's just a coping mechanism.
12. The day after my grandma died, my wife's best friend went to the hospital. She had been sick with strep throat (she thought) - but the antibiotics she got didn't do anything.Turns out it was Acute (the bad kind) Leukemia. She was 31. We were at her wedding just after the quarantines ended. She just had a baby - 7 months old.The doctors did some tests and said her heart was really strong - it wasn't a matter of ""survival"" but a matter of ""curing.""Last Thursday she texted my wife to say the chemo wasn't that bad. Friday morning they made plans for her to visit over the weekend.... then her heart just stopped. And the revived her. And then her heart stopped again. This went on for 12 fucking hours before she died for the last time.

\-------------

My grandmother's funeral was yesterday. My wife's best friend's funeral is tomorrow, and I'm so fatigued from loss I just don't feel anything. Honestly, I stopped being able to cry after my dad died.

I keep thinking to myself this must be what being in a war feels like - there's so much death happening near you that you just become numb.

I've been to a therapist - but I can hardly get through 1/2 of the deaths before time is up - and then it's another three month wait.... and that's not even scratching the cult-mommy absent-daddy issues. He says it's normal not to feel anything, but I really want to. 

It's been two years now and the only time I can cry like I want is when I get shitfaced - I'm talking pants-on-head drunk. I don't really drink much though.

I just feel like I'm holding up all this weight, and I don't have any way to put it down....

Anyway, if you've made it this far - thanks for reading. I don't know what to expect from putting this here - I think in spite of everything I'm doing kind of ok. It just makes me feel better to write this stuff down, I guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/yqch6f/everyone_around_me_is_dying_but_all_i_feel_is/,1667981560.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1fe2mmg,MentalHealthSupport,My gf exhibits childlike behavior and hides in closet; childhood trauma?,"My gf of two years, charming and so sweet, exhibits childlike behavior. Like having ice cream to cheer her up. Or wanting to be tucked in before sleep which makes her so happy and giddy, in a very real way. She‚Äôs a writer and writes very sweet words, stories and poetry. She has little emotional boundary with the outside world; others‚Äô pain affects her, and so does people‚Äôs joys. She can revert to talking cute-sy and like a little girl with funny English: ‚Äúit best!‚Äù

She is nothing short of a wonderful human being with a gigantic loving heart. But she also suffers, in her early 20s she experienced a break up and that stressed her body to the point of getting a nasty condition called ulcer colitis, an immunity disorder. She lives with this frightening condition for years and has to take injections to ease the symptoms every month. 

When in stressful times she can run into the closet and stay in it while crying. She doesn‚Äôt have much emotional regulation control and it scares her so she runs and sits in physical pain I. The closet crying. 

I‚Äôm wondering if there is a deeper root of some kind of child trauma? Where do I begin looking into it?

i81250,MentalHealthSupport,Help/advice,"Ok so my bf (44) has chronic mental illness and debilitating ulcerative colitis.
He was 15 when his colon was removed and has 2 other organs removed as well since. 

plus he deals with cyclothymia (a severe type of bi polar disorder) where his moods rapidly change causing him more stress and anxiety. He also suffers from PTSD with reoccurring nightmares leaving him sleepless most days. 
It was mostly caused from years ago childhood abuse and watching his mother be abuses by his father. 
Among other things...


When he was 15 he was approved for social security after his colon was removed.
He denied it cos he didnt want to be in a category of disabled at such a young age (on disabilty)

He had a colostomy bag for a year n at that time was told it would always be there.
He denied ssi and worked very hard to get his body in check n now doesnt need the colostomy bag. Actually only needed when he was recovering that 1 year. 
He wven had to learn to walk again even...
10th grade that was for him.

Now, due to his intense surgeries he had at a young age, they had to put him into a coma with pain meds. 
You know what happens when a 15 years old kid gets put on a morphine drip for a year?

So, fast forward to his time to leave.
He now has been in the hospital recovering from something he didnt ask for, couldnt be prevented,¬† and almost killed him.
N was mostly likely caused from the stress he endured from his own family for 15 years.
So now 
He is a full blown morphine addict (thanks big pharma) and has pain no 15 year old should ever encounter. 

This unfortunally leads him down a very long and dark path to alleviate his physical pain and escape his mental abuse, he turns to heroin.
Now, this led him down a path of crime and addiction that took him 22 years to pull awau from. 

He has been sober for 5 years now
And now more than ever he needs help.
Government help, he cant work yet is forced to in order to keep his insurance. 

Without his insurance he wouldn't be able to afford his meds for his ulcers. 
He is sick everynight and every bite of food he takes reacts like poison in his gut. 

Idk what to do anymore, in thr town we live in hes gotten denied social sec 2 times. 
The lawyers and doctors all reassure him its ""cut n dry"" and he does need it.
His illnesses are chronic and it breaks my heart what the judges do n say to him based on his criminal past with drug use.
*which was all caused by both of his illnesses in effort to help pain/cope/escape. 

We're only fucking human and we all fuck up but fuck it if i havent seen someone try till their blue in the face just to be knocked back down.

He was told by the judge he only wants this monthly as a means to buy drugs n get off on the government. 
Fuck that.
REALLY? $600 A MONTH? 
FUCK THEM
600 a mo barely a livable wage, n the judge (who knows the least n didnt read his file beyond previous drug addict) is the one who makes the final decision?

WTF. 
So just wondered if anyone out there has had similar expierences and how they handled it.

1m4um1k,MentalHealthSupport,"Help. Struggling with Anxiety, DPDR, and Ruminating Thoughts. Seeking Advice and Perspectives","Hello, everyone. I‚Äôm 19 years old and have been struggling with mental health issues for years (substance use, DPDR, anxiety, etc.).

I‚Äôm attaching my clinical case for anyone interested in reading it to better understand and possibly help me:  
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMdted3ptZWAko8EqmMx71XieLaOco9Jaw-lGmrUEwQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMdted3ptZWAko8EqmMx71XieLaOco9Jaw-lGmrUEwQ/edit?usp=sharing)  
Besides the symptoms of disconnection from reality that I can‚Äôt control, today I want to talk about ruminating thoughts and the infamous anxiety, which is likely the root of all my problems.  
To give some context, I have a genetic predisposition to anxiety (my sister has depression and OCD). Here‚Äôs my story:

As a child, I was always a nervous person (they suspected I had ADHD, but it was ruled out). However, during childhood, I never lacked basic needs, and I didn‚Äôt experience trauma or abuse, at least not that I‚Äôm aware of.  
Later, in adolescence, my psychosocial development wasn‚Äôt the best since I didn‚Äôt socialize much with friends.  
At 17, I started experiencing mild obsessive thoughts or OCD-like symptoms. A few months later, I began using cannabis regularly, which worsened my mental state.  
After a summer at 18 marked by alcohol, cocaine, and occasional other substances, I started noticing a sense of unreality, feeling dissociated or strange, along with mental fog (like I wasn‚Äôt myself, like something had changed in me).  
I was prescribed psychiatric medication, sertraline, which seemed to help a bit in the first few months but then tapered off in effectiveness.  
As time went on, I stayed the same. I continued occasionally drinking alcohol (which might have caused the medication to not work as it should) and using cocaine and MDMA sporadically.

Now, in 2025, at almost 20 years old, after a suicide attempt, I find myself at the lowest point of my life.  
The reason I‚Äôm posting in this subreddit is to ask about some concerns or fears that haunt my mind almost every day. My main fear is living in this state in a finite life like the one we have, feeling like I‚Äôm wasting my life, suffering while alive. As a child, I was afraid of death because I genuinely enjoyed life. Every time an obsessive thought pops up, I try to research to calm myself, but it often fuels my anxiety instead.  
I‚Äôm aware that many people have it worse than me (abuse, severe drug addiction, war, lack of food), and Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs reflects that well. But that doesn‚Äôt mean mental health issues should be minimized. Many people can‚Äôt empathize because their receptors aren‚Äôt dysregulated.Another concern is that I‚Äôll never be like I was before. Maybe I was chasing an unrealistic mental state back then, but I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm now in a situation where I have no hope of getting out.

I also have a lot of respect (and fear) for drugs, especially using them at 17-18 when the brain is still developing, particularly the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. That said, at this age, the brain also has a lot of neuroplasticity.  
My fear of drugs has always been part of my ruminations, especially in combination with antidepressants. While both are psychoactive, my concern is whether my mental state is a result of these factors.  
In these cases, a mental state like mine usually isn‚Äôt caused by a single factor‚Äîit‚Äôs also influenced by psychosocial development, genetics, etc.I want to feel like a person again someday, with the desire to do things, enjoy life, and be emotionally and mentally stable. But I feel like I‚Äôve been unwell for so long that I no longer know what it means to feel good.

I‚Äôve always been a bit hypochondriac, and I believe that what‚Äôs happening to me is not just functional but structural‚Äîlike encephalopathy, oxidative stress, dead neurons, or something like that. However, I‚Äôve never had serotonin syndrome, fainting, or alarming symptoms like high fever or coma. In 2023, I had a CT scan and blood tests, and everything came back normal.I‚Äôm functional‚ÄîI can write this, reason, read, walk, and do leisure activities‚Äîbut I do it like I‚Äôm on autopilot, with a feeling that something‚Äôs missing, like I‚Äôm living but dead inside.  
I think I might be a non-responder to SSRIs, or my receptors have developed tolerance, or they‚Äôll never work. I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre supposed to work in the sense of ‚Äúnow I feel good.‚Äù What does feeling good even mean? What‚Äôs the ideal mental state? The only thing I maybe noticed with SSRIs was some control over obsessive thoughts, but as you can see, the ruminations are still there.Emotions are another issue, or rather, vivid thoughts, euphoria, desires, dreams, motivations‚ÄîI‚Äôm in a state of emotional flatness. I obviously have emotions; if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt care about my mental state.  
I‚Äôm thinking about getting an EEG or more tests to calm myself because I can‚Äôt keep going like this.

I also think suicide is not an option. Even though I attempted it, no matter how bad things get, you have to think about the pain you‚Äôd cause your loved ones and consider that one day, maybe you won‚Äôt be perfect, but at least you won‚Äôt be suffering. And here‚Äôs the crux of it: Where‚Äôs the origin? What‚Äôs the trigger? Why am I like this?  
This is the end of my post. I just want to hear your perspectives, as well as thoughts on the fears and concerns I‚Äôve shared.

1lrvfyl,MentalHealthSupport,Does this sound like a flashback or panic attack?,"Hi all! 

I hope this is okay to post here. I really hope my post makes sense because none of it makes sense to me and it's hard to explain. 

I was severely abused as a child by my mother (I won't go into detail obviously)

For the last few years, I've been having what I thought were panic attacks.

It usually comes out of nowhere, but I'll have mental images or thoughts of being in my childhood home. 

Nothing is particularly happening (as in no abuse) and sometimes I'll get images of my family being there included. 

I then get this weird (bad) feeling come over me, almost a feeling I felt being in that house when I was a child, but I'm unsure why or if that is what it is. It's as if I'm back there again. 

I then become a bit lightheaded, hot, feel sick and have vomited previously due to this, my heart pounds, feel panicky etc. 

It can last for 20 seconds or up to several minutes. 

I have absolutely no idea what it is. 

It used to happen every once in a while, then maybe every other week. I've had this happen multiple times over the last few days though. 

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? 

I've not been inside that house for about 16 years, since I was about 11/12 due to us moving when I was younger.

1lm4fx4,MentalHealthSupport,Nocturnal Panic Attacks - 22 yr old Female,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm not new to reddit but this is my first time posting. I was wondering if anyone had advice and/or remedies that could help with something I‚Äôve been suffering from for quite a few months now.

I have a history of anxiety/panic attacks along with a couple of other disorders. For some time, I thought everything was going well. My attacks were at bay, was getting relatively adequate sleep (I used to work nights so this was a challenge here and there). The only thing amiss was my sleep paralysis, however, this is something I‚Äôve experienced since childhood. I‚Äôve just sort of accepted my sleep paralysis will never go away and because of this, I have become much more accustomed to it over the years. Episodes now are not nearly as frightening and I‚Äôve found ways to ‚Äúcome out of them‚Äù so to speak.

However, there is something else as of late. At first I didn‚Äôt know exactly what these weird attacks were (I did not know you could have panic attacks at night). I figured perhaps it was sleep apnea because my father has the condition, but this has since been ruled out, of course. Everyone experiences those bizarre ‚Äújolts‚Äù when they‚Äôre falling into deep sleep, but what I am experiencing is that x100. I‚Äôll be falling to sleep and suddenly I sit up, my heart racing, gasping for air, tremors, with the feeling of impending doom. Like I‚Äôm about to die or the world is going to end. The attacks are so severe that some nights, I will avoid going back to sleep (through watching tv, walking around the house, cleaning, etc), out of fear that I will have another attack. Other nights, I will be in deep sleep and I will have been asleep for several hours when I immediately jolt up with these same feelings. Whenever this happens, I always have thoughts that my partner sleeping next to me is dead. I will check his breathing and pulse, which is always fine of course. But I will be so panicked that something would happen to him if I go back to sleep. So, I stay up. I have relayed this info to my partner and he has stated that he believes these attacks stem from PTSD. For context, many loved ones of mine have passed away in the last few years, particularly my mother and then-boyfriend. He says that I‚Äôm subconsciously afraid that I will wake up to someone else being dead so my body wakes itself up to ‚Äúbeat this fear to the punch‚Äù so to speak. In addition to these nocturnal panic attacks, my daytime panic attacks have also spiked dramatically. Since all of this has happened, I have since visited my primary care physician to get a referral to a psychiatrist, however, getting seen by one will take months. I can‚Äôt bear to suffer from these attacks for any longer. My PCP has prescribed me a .5mg dose of Xanax and he is currently prescribing me different SSRIs and antipsychotics to help with the problem in the meantime. First, he prescribed me Vraylar, which I took for two weeks. I stopped taking it because it was making my muscles twitch and caused extreme restlessness, which worsened my anxiety. Now he has instead prescribed me Zoloft and Abilify to try out. I am starting these this Sunday (06/29/25) once I finish these last two night shifts (my coworker is currently on vacation and I am filling in for her). I don‚Äôt want to be on medication though. I never wanted to go on medication. It‚Äôs a death sentence in my eyes. If I absolutely have to take it, then I guess I‚Äôll do just that but I‚Äôd rather quite literally anything else. 

I just don‚Äôt understand. Why have these attacks spawned all of a sudden. My mother died 4 years ago. My then-boyfriend died almost 2 1/2 years ago. The last death I have experienced was my dog, whom passed in March of this year. I was doing okay before all of this. My mental health wasn‚Äôt perfect by any means but it is now at an all time low. I feel like my mind is rotting. I want these thoughts, the attacks, everything to stop. I just want peace. 

Does anyone have advice? How do I put an end to this? Diet recommendations, exercise routines, meditation practices, anything. Anything. I will try anything. I am utterly desperate. If I take this medication and I see good progress then I will continue to take it but I don‚Äôt want to be on meds long term. The goal would be to get off of them as soon as possible. Any advice and recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you to those who took the time to read this. I hope everyone has an awesome blossom day. Take care.

1lf2u32,MentalHealthSupport,"TLDR: I had a panic attack In front of my parents. the next week, they laughed and made jokes about it in an Olive Garden. Advice? I don't really know what to do about this issue anymore.","(this is also posted on r/Advice, I just didn't know whether it would go under this or r/Advice, so I put it in both)

Context: I (16M) have very traditional Indian parents (around 40 in age, I don't wanna give too much personal info). They are good in many regards, they do help me with my college goals, and studies and band. I don't have a problem with any of that, even if they are strict. But they never seem to care about anything that isn't academics. If I bring up something not directly related to studies, they either give a vague answer, or divert the topic back to studies. I have put up with this for 16 years now, it has never changed, even after many promises of change. On the way back from a road trip in Indiana, When we were 2 hours away from home, They suddenly brought up how I should study more and more, and that I won't have anymore free time so I can focus on my SAT and ACT. ""Ok, a little weird, but not exactly unusual"" I think, but they keep pressing the issue. When we got home, they continued, and we started a back and forth, but they kept interrupting me, and laughing when I brought up certain issues, like how they sometimes don't take even great results, such as a 98th percentile in the state exams, as a good result, but they go ""oh, it's alright"" or ""Not good, Not good"". More issues get brought up, and they keep laughing, and when I finally ask them why are they keep laughing, they laughed again, and that kinda broke me. I started crying. a lot. I couldn't think or speak clearly, I felt like I was alone, I felt like I was being mocked for having feelings. All I could think was every time, since I was 3 that I had been laughed at for my problems, or scolded for getting an 87 on a test, or scolded for saying a grievance And these were all point we had talked about before this whole situation, but now, suddenly, it feels less significant. But, after that day, I decide to just, push my feelings aside, ""Why let them hold me down, right?"" A week later, I pitch the idea of going to Olive Garden, not to discuss, but because we haven't been in a restaurant in ages. They agree, and we head out. It goes a bit well, until they get into old habits of interrupting me mid sentence or just not listening until I raise my voice a bit. But, when they do, they start over dramatically pinching their noses, and recreating my panic attack and making jokes and visual gags out of it. Right there. at dinner time. In an Olive Garden. People were starring, it was embarrassing? Humiliating? I don't know what it's called, but I just didn't like it. They stop after a while, and again, I try to be a bigger person, I try to move, I try to take it on the chin, like I have for the past 16 years of life. But It's starting to not work. I still feel hurt, I can't distract myself from these jokes, I feel hurt that this is even a discussion I have to make. And now, I'm looking back, and I'm getting the feeling that when they say my academic results aren't good, they aren't joking. I get that all A's are not quite the best, there's always an A+ but I feel it's at least decent, at least good enough for an acknowledgement? And I'm trying to improve, this really is just my POV, maybe in 10 years, when I finish my Ph.D I'll realize I was being under or overdramatic, but that's not what I care about right now. I feel lost. I don't know what to do, where to go, whether I should ignore all this and keep pushing on like I have been or talk about it but get the same results or bother my friends for once and tell them what's been going on. And don't make a mistake here, I have a good life in every other regard, My band friends are great, the staff are great, everyone I know In school is great, I'm getting better at playing euphonium, I went from first chair bottom band to second chair top band, which is a huge step, and I do like my life. I have so much I wanna do, but, I feel lost in the place that I'm supposed to be comforted in. I don't know where to go, how to deal with this, but trying to be the bigger person and be nice is getting tiring. I'm getting burnt out of being nice about this issue. But I don't like being not nice, and I don't wanna start here. I don't know where to go from here. Any advice?

Thank you so much for reading, I know it's a lot.

1lmgk02,MentalHealthSupport,My brain only works when I'm stressed/in pain. What do I do with that information?,"To start off, I'm in therapy. 

The therapy I'm in is supposed to be trauma focused (paid for by victims support) but I can use it for whatever  because I was so young and have the right kind of trauma to bypass most medical bureaucracy because NO ONE wants details. Please read that as bitterly as I said it. 

I went into therapy with a somewhat unconventional goal of ""I want to turn into a cold bastard with a harsh fight response and be hyper competent at anything I set my mind to"" 

I've actually kind of made progress towards that. Now my main issue is. If I'm not in a high stress situation, nothing gets done. I don't even waste time with unproductive things I enjoy. It's all just brain rot I don't even want to do. 

Me and my therapist listed some things that gets me in the headspace I like being in. 

That list includes 
-extreame cold
- hunger/exhaustion 
-loading up on caffeine and the occasional stimulant
-Playing video games that are intensely difficult 

But pretty much all of them have like a 50% chance of working at best. And the rest of the time I'm just so bored with my life. 

And my life is going well. I've got a plan that will provide me all the stress I'm craving right now. Unfortunately that plan cannot be done for another year. So I have a whole year, and a whole load of things I'd love to do while I still have free time. And yet, because there is no extreme external stress I can't do any of them.

Just for context here are the kind of things I want to do. 
-Get properly invested in Magic The Gathering so I can actually play well and stop feeling like the noob at the table
-Program a GUI I had an idea for
-finish my TBR pile
-learn Guitar 
-Make a video game, just to see if I can
-Finish all the art projects I have ideas for. 

These are all fun things that I would love doing. But I can't do any of them without extreme stress, and fun things don't usually provide extreme stress. 

I need the kind of stress that makes you feel like you'll die if you fail. 

Honestly if it was slightly more socially acceptable I'd cut myself everytime I lost focus just to get things done. 

TLDR: I'm bored with my life and need to find ways to stress myself out so I can live my life.

1l6xlu5,MentalHealthSupport,Live in constant stress,"This is a long story.

I'm a 28-year-old male living in Sri Lanka. When I was 18, my parents and astrologers told me I would become a medical doctor. But I didn‚Äôt really understand what was being taught in school. Around that time, I was more interested in computer games and staying up to date with new technology.

As the academic pressure increased, I started listening to Buddhist sermons to deal with the stress. Over the past 10 years, I‚Äôve been regularly listening to these sermons. After failing my A-levels, I spent most of my time listening to Dhamma talks. That was also when my hair loss began, and I experienced constant stress.

The sermons emphasized the cycle of rebirth and how 99.999% of beings go to hell and suffer for eons. This terrified me. To make it more confusing, many of the sermons contradicted each other. I didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore.

Eventually, I started a software engineering degree. Even though I lost my passion partway through, I was able to graduate with a First Class due to what I believe is my inborn talent.

During that time, I also started a relationship with one of my cousins. But I ended up hurting her. I was anxious and scared, especially when unknown numbers called her. I couldn‚Äôt handle it. Eventually, she left me because I wasn‚Äôt changing. That experience hit me really hard‚ÄîI truly loved her.

After that, I was attracted to a few other girls, but I never started a relationship. My mind kept saying, ""You still love her. There‚Äôs no love left for anyone else."" Another astrologer even told me she would never get married. Now, at 28, a astrologer tell me not to even think about marriage until 2030.

Today, I work as a software engineer. Recently, I met a monk who told me some things about my past that were surprisingly accurate. I never believed such things were possible. He also told me not to do business, just as I was planning to start one. He spoke again about rebirth‚Äîand the scary part is, some researchers and even people like Edgar Cayce have said similar things about reincarnation. Even Nadi astrologers told me I would either become a doctor or an engineer.

Two weeks ago, I felt like I had finally broken free from the fear of rebirth. A monk once said:

""When we put value on anything, we want it to be ours. That desire becomes a weight on our minds. Then we take action to relieve that pressure, thinking those actions will bring happiness. But the actions themselves aren‚Äôt happiness. When we succeed and gain the thing, the pressure lifts and the mind feels a gap‚Äîthat's what we call happiness. But afterward, we fear losing it. So the whole cycle is suffering.""


This teaching gave me a huge sense of relief. I thought I had finally understood it‚Äîand that maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be reborn in hell.

But then I met that same monk again. He looked into me and said, ‚ÄúYou still haven‚Äôt understood. Listen to more sermons.‚Äù

Since 2021, I‚Äôve also been taking medication to manage stress. But over time, I feel like I‚Äôm no longer me. I‚Äôve lost hope in everything. I don't have a clear identity anymore. My mind feels fragmented between fear, logic, belief, and doubt.

What I really need now is a solid, foolproof way to look at the world‚Äîsomething grounded, something I can hold on to.

1lpdedp,MentalHealthSupport,Is it unreasonable that I'm depressed for having gotten banned from too many subreddits and forums?,"The other day, I got banned from one more subreddit (I've lost count of how many subreddits I've been banned from so far), and that drove the knife deeper, perhaps it's the straw that broke the camel's back. Ever since I joined Reddit, no matter how hard I try to be polite and nice to everyone, I can't stop getting banned from subreddits, and the reasons are usually trivial.

I mean, it's not like the subs' mods begin with a warning or a temporary ban. As soon as I do something wrong, trivial or not, they always go straight to the permanent solution. And they don't respond to my appeals; they don't give me a chance to apologize.

It can't be an issue of weird mods every time. There must be something seriously wrong with me. It's not only about Reddit. Things are the same on Facebook and online forums. I just can't stay anywhere online for long.

Is it unreasonable that that's a reason for me to be depressed and stop caring about everything in life? I mean, the fact that I'm unwelcome everywhere online indicates I'm an unlikeable person, which explains why I've never had friends in real life either.

I tried to improve my social skills recently, as you can see on¬†[THIS¬†](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1k6pbfx/is_it_too_late_to_get_social_skills_as_an_adult/)post, but the fact that I received another permanent ban the other day shows I haven't improved after all. I keep being an asshole, and sooner or later, I will always end up doing something that will get me banished. That's why nothing seems important to me anymore.

The book I've been writing, my ambition to get it published and become a famous author, the prospect of transferring my consciousness to other realities (you can read more about that technique on¬†[r/realityshifting](https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/), which is where I got banned from by the way), everything seems pointless to me now that I've come to terms with the fact that no one shall ever like me.

1ltxgfy,MentalHealthSupport,Should I call mobile crisis for my parent?,"Hi, so I have an out of state parent who developed hallucinations and delusions in their 50s after a lot of trauma and depression, a very toxic relationship with a much younger partner who slowly moved into their life and eventually convinced him to try amphetamines. I am very confident they are drug free now as their behavior and appearance have changed drastically since I knew they were using and confronted them. DCF already became involved when the relationship resulted in a baby. I‚Äôm unsure of the mother because her everyday state of being is chaotic and manic. It has been about 2-3 years of this parents clear hallucinations and delusions. After much difficulty we were able to get him to a crisis center for an in person evaluation last year, but he was able to talk his way around it and was prescribed medication and asked to return but not admitted and of course did not return. Then later after many more struggles and homelessness we were able to get him to a case management agency, where he was prescribed medication for sleep, depression, and antipsychotics. He picked them up and of course claimed to be taking them, but we could only give him the benefit of the doubt. He is no longer attending his case management appointments and absolutely no longer taking any medications if he ever was. We tried to advocate for the injectable but they said they can‚Äôt do that until/unless he‚Äôs prescribed oral medications and it‚Äôs deemed necessary after a while, and he has to consent. He also has strong family history of Alzheimer‚Äôs. His mother developed Alzheimer‚Äôs in her 50s. Both of his parents have passed away and both siblings passed in 2023 in their 50s. 

So. He is still hallucinating and tries to avoid speaking to myself, my other adult sibling, and my great aunt who are the only people left in his life attempting to help him.. because he doesn‚Äôt want to scare us or bring us down and knows/suspects we don‚Äôt believe him. My sibling and I live out of state. 

His hallucinations and delusions involve perceived hidden tattoos under his skin that he believes are threats from some outside entity that changes slightly every time im able to engage him in a conversation about his beliefs. But we have known him to be trying to cut the tattoos out of his skin on multiple occasions; periods in between he claims he‚Äôs stopped due to our urgency and also when we took him to crisis because he knows he will likely be admitted involuntarily and is afraid, for good reason, he‚Äôll lose custody of the child. Yet he‚Äôs still wearing long sleeves and pants now well into the summer and it‚Äôs suspected he‚Äôs still trying to cut tattoos off his skin. My relative who lives in town reports seeing him recently and he had bruises on his face and a cut on his lip that he refused to discuss. There is also a history of the child‚Äôs mother punching him and becoming violent during bouts of drunkenness and mania. He currently lives with the child‚Äôs mother and her boyfriend (and the child) although they haven‚Äôt been dating for 2+ years due to prior homelessness but supposedly has been working full time again at a great job for the past 6 months or so, which is very near the child‚Äôs mothers current home, and he doesn‚Äôt have reliable transportation. 

So. I think reporting the self harm would get him involuntarily admitted, which risks his job and his relationship with his child, but at the same time I suppose so do his beliefs and the way he‚Äôs (not) handling them. 

Do I call mobile crisis to his current address now that we‚Äôve attempted to have him assessed in person and taken him to a psychiatrist (who did not admit him and who suspected a rare vision disorder called Charles Bennett but he never followed up) and a case management agency? 

Even doing so and even if they elect to admit him my concern is that he can only be held for so long and I‚Äôve heard follow thru after discharge is still rare.

1k017km,MentalHealthSupport,Found out I have genetic mutations! F(24),"Bipolar runs in my family and I suffer from swings so this year I was in a good place and started considering a psychiatrist. When I first met her she said she specialized in genetics and certain things can show on genetic testing to put us on the right path! If you're interested they can show if you're prone to certain things like Alzheimer's ect. Since Bipolar isnt a socially developed disorder it would show up that i have the genes like my brother or father. Just wanting an answer I didnt care either way but I learned I have two mental mutations that apparently are rarer and only happen if both of my parents have very specific genes. If you dont have someone to decipher these papers they dont make much sense. But heres the science!! -> Your brain takes b12 and b16 to turn into the chemicals such as dopamine, seratonin, addrenaline, and something else. Basically most of your emotional chemicals then they are transmitted to where they need to go! This transmitter is sort of like a bus . My first mutation is instead of a long bus i have a short car. Known as SLC6A4 short/short. I cant take as many chemicals to the destination. when youre depressed and need antidepressents they are inputting more of those chemicals, or with adhd inputting more dopamine ect. Those things wont help me because i have enough developed but they arent going anywhere. when the chemicals go where they are needed (this is where im a little fuzzy) Stress also goes to that part of the brain but theres these little guys who clean it all out at the end of the day. My second mutation is COMPT met/met Val158Met. From what i understand i have fewer guys who clean out the joint. my levels say instead of starting the next day at 0 I have 68% higher levels of stress than the average person. Mixed with extremely low levels of vitamin D i suffer with attention issues, sleep issues, depression swings ect. The next step is Vitamin D supplements mood stabilizers and Magnesium Glycinate to create more cleaners and better transportation. I would love to hear more about these types of mutations or other peoples experiences since I found it so incredibly interesting.

1g4yre3,MentalHealthSupport,"Elderly person with mental health issues being discharged from housing, now what?","We have been trying to figure out what to do with our family member who is about to be given a formal 30 day notice at her current assisted living facility.

  
EDIT: State is PA, if that makes a difference.

Background info:

She is currently late 70s with diagnosed bipolar disorder with possible other undiagnosed mental health issues. It seems like each appointment with any mental health professional gives a slightly different response, but bipolar seems to be the only consistent diagnosis. She is currently highly manic.

We had taken over as PoA for her finances about a year ago and have recently have acquired guardianship for her medically. She was determined to have no capacity to make any medical or financial decisions for herself. She is a ""functional"" human, but would say she most closely behaves like an 8 year old.

Was taken care of by her mother until roughly 5 years ago when she passed away. Since then, she lived alone in her mother's house for a brief stint and was eventually moved into a personal care facility, this all occurred prior to our intervention a little over a year ago. Since then, she was kicked out the last facility and we found her another, which is the one she is about to be kicked out now.

She does have minimal money in the bank, which would have lasted her another 2 or so years with her soon to be previous facility, so it seems like Medicaid is not immediately the answer either. She does not have a memory diagnosis (Alzheimer's, dementia, etc.) so the additional services that come with that do not apply either.

She has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for behavioral issues, each of which concluding with her getting a minimum couple of days to about a month at the longest being in a psych ward until they can stabilize her with medication enough to get her sent back to her facility.

What we have done so far:

As mentioned above, taken over financial PoA and medical guardianship.

The lawyer we used for guardianship has referred us to someone in the practice who may be able to help with ""fighting for"" housing, but it is on us to find a place that is a fir for her.

Contacted the local Department of Aging. They have been zero help at each call and essentially just compliment how ""we already seem to have a good handle on this"" and don't think they need to intervene.

She sees a Psychiatrist monthly and Psychologist weekly. On a bunch of medicines which have been going through some updates to hopefully stabilize her a bit right now.

Where we are now:

She is about to be kicked out of her current facility for behaviors. To not get into the details, this is primarily due to a combination of aggression towards staff and other residents and sexually promiscuous behaviors.

To anyone thinking ""Why don't you just take her in?"", this is not an option. As you have read she has a history of mental health issues that require 24/7 care and my spouse and I cannot accommodate this. Between space in our house, hoping to find appropriate in home care that never cancels (does not exist), and just the general thought of how unpleasant it would be to have her in the home, makes this the end of that option. We want that best for her and will fight for that, it just will not be in our house.

My dad tries to help on what he can, he also suffers seeing her like this but all that we could do we did, but she isn't getting better, and like, she's my mom, it kills me seeing her like this and not being able to fix it somehow or do something that'll make her get better. Also, i've realized now that for those 10yrs since my sister died she wasn't never really genuinely happy, it was just medication effect, and that is killing me, know that the piece of shit that was my sister managed to achieve the only thing she truly wanted - to destroy my mom, and that she's not been really happy, just high on medication. Anyway, i cry myself to sleep everyday after i put her to sleep because i don't know what else to do, and i also know that long term depression medication can cause Alzheimer and etc..., and just to add some extra guilt it also kills me knowing that she's slowly leaving this world and is not going to meet my children and be the best grandma ever (as she was the best mom ever) . I'm 28, she's 65 and my dad is 72, and because i can't even do a simple thing such as meeting a decent guy and getting pregnant, my mom and dad are probably not going to meet their grandchildren, wich was always literally my biggest fear.

45 million living Americans on their way to a coffin caused by Alzheimer‚Äôs/Dementia(diabetes type 3), the vast majority of us could use less carbohydrates. Auto immune conditions including Alz/Dem- are virtually 100% reversible according to many medical experts who actually care about preventative medicine. Rather focusing on lifespan but health span. Spending the last days of your beautiful life thriving, not suffering with pharmaceuticals(19 out of 20 board members on our nutritional guidelines for America are tied to pharmaceutical companies). Live life how you were suppose to if you like to complain or you‚Äôre finding no success. Sleep. Movement/exercise. Diet, structured hydration/nature,sun, ground/socialize/play. I lost my purpose at the age 19 during water polo practice. Suffering from a Thoracic Aortic dissection and abdominal aneurysm, experiencing spinal cord ischemia, put on dialysis, not enough blood to brain, organs, limbs for 12 hours. I am now partially physically disabled for life not being able to strain or stress my chest wall or abdominal muscles. Cardiologist described it as a continuous ticking time bomb in my chest- Due to a genetic condition called Ehlers Danlos syndrome(affecting my connective tissue basically being very weak)Prescribed with 3 blood pressure medications for life(which absolutely demolished my drive, sex drive, confidence, life). Also dealing with celiac disease, gastronomic intestinal issues, lactose intolerance, low white blood cell count my whole life.

M23 here, really losing hope things can ever become bearable.. I‚Äòve never had the hardest childhood or anything, but always had some level of health problems (strong allergies, mouth breathing, probably addicted to sugar) and just feel like overall I was neglected.. always left to play games on consoles, never really was the active type and overall just feel like I didnt grow up in the most educated environment. I wasnt really tought to take responsibility and everything I at the time thought was necessary for living was kind of taken care of for me, but I can still remember never having been the happiest child.. fast forward to my teenage years I was bullied in school and soon started to be a loner and not really learn how to connect with people and reality on a deeper level.. I continued being on devices and from 15 also started a problematic use of alcohol cannabis and tobacco, getting blackout drunk a good amount of times in my life and also having smoked weed basically daily the past 5 years‚Ä¶ never really felt like I had any viable talents, I was able to make a few songs of rap music here and there over the last years, but nothing giving me enough courage to push it out in my local community‚Ä¶ overall to fast forward, i‚Äòve always felt a deep sense of emptiness in my life and was also diagnosed with major depressive disorder.. while I am in an apprenticeship for finances right now, a recent breakup has put me through a lot of emotional turmoil.. the past few weeks things really took a turn for worse though.. while my memory hasnt been the greatest in a long time, my attention span and memory has gotten so bad I can barely remember anything and even feel like my long term memory is busted.. I can barely get up in the mornings no matter the amount of time I sleep, and also dont feel like it either and literally have my brain throw only worrisome and self resenting thoughts at me the moment i gain consciousness.. I barely manage to stay awake and handle even the bare minimum survival tasks like eating and drinking and have resorted to relying on ordering food or eating takeout since I feel like my energy levels are so depleted.. I also never really got into a habit of cooking for myself consistently as coming up with nutrition ideas daily to keep eating fun and healthy, besides the little time I feel like I have on the work days (mo-fr). even though I know being on socials and scrolling all the time probably wont improve my health and memory, which cant retain any information anyways, I also dont know what other activities to engage in and this fleeting memory problem has even led me into an anxiety of becoming homeless. At the same time it feels like I have given up on trying to hold on to life and I make careless decisions, be it financially or health wise, while I‚Äòm sober it feels like I don‚Äòt care at all about getting my life in order as my energy levels are so depleted and my past lifestyle also just made me look and feel like a zombie‚Ä¶ I‚Äòve even been to a mental health clinic 2 years ago where all I did was basically lie in bed in my free time and while I attained all the program there I just felt like it didnt change me in the slightest, therapy sessions I could barely talk and explain my situation and thoughts, just feel like I‚Äòve lost all emotions‚Ä¶ and knowledge too.. obviously the few friends i have noticed this too and at this point i literally feel ashamed to even go up to anybody and try to talk because i feel like i have the conscious level of a 5 year old.. all in all i just dont see any point in living like this anymore because i‚Äòm literally not able to live life independently and i cant even fulfil my basic needs in a healthy way, apart from the constant fatigue and memory of a toast. I just waste away my time with cheap dopamine watching myself deplete without power to stop it and even when I‚Äòm trying to read a book or upping my knowledge I, or go to the gym, I cant retain the information, discipline or energy needed to follow through with the bare minimum life demands from me.

1dpxol9,MentalHealthSupport,My mom is in the beginning/middle stages of dementia and refuses to get help. ,"My mom has been suffering from undiagnosed dementia for a few years now. It started out as memory lapses, trouble finding the right word, remembering people, etc. At the time, my dad took her in for a screening and an MRI found nothing wrong with her. 

Over the last few years it‚Äôs gotten worse. Her situation has been compounded by what we assume (from the context of her outbursts and rumors within her family) was a history of sexual abuse from her dad as a child. Things are getting really bad. She has angry outbursts directed at my dad and threatens to leave, which means she just walks out of the house to who knows where. She‚Äôs also scared of being put in a home and too paranoid to trust my family to even go into the city with them. She absolutely refuses to see a doctor. 

Without a proper diagnosis she cannot get the help she needs‚Äî medication that might make things better for her or other treatments. This has been very hard on my dad who loves her dearly and has been nothing but loving and supportive their whole marriage. I‚Äôm sure this situation is (sadly) not all that unique. Does anyone have any advice for getting her to a doctor? Are there any programs for getting a doctor to come to her? She lives in a very small town about two hours from the nearest big city.

1l9pff5,MentalHealthSupport,Please help,"I am dealing with a family member that has the worst depression in someone I have ever seen and desperately needs help but won‚Äôt get themselves help and I can‚Äôt force them. I truly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore or how to help. I‚Äôm desperate and incredibly depleted trying to support her. I think something more than just depression could be going on like a personality disorder, dementia or something else. Again, I don‚Äôt know how to help her, I‚Äôm not a doctor and just at a loss. She doesn‚Äôt listen to anything I say to try to help and it just is the same cycle constantly. This is traumatizing me. I will list some symptoms for people to better understand what we are dealing with:

-Extreme Depression 

-Constantly crying (all day, multiple times a day)

-Fixation on certain things, won‚Äôt/can not let things go

-Every single thing in life is stressful to her (normal things) 

-Repeating the same conversations over and over 
Ex. I got two offers on the house (saying that 5 times in one phone call) the next day texting I got an offer on the house (so I will think oh she got another offer but it‚Äôs the same ones) On the phone after the text saying 3+ times I got an offer on the house and will continue to say the amounts when she has shared this information 10+ times. When I say you already told me she says I know‚Ä¶having these repeating conversations all day all the time is exhausting me 


-Saying the same things over and over or asking the same question (Asking when are you moving into your new house to my sibling when she has been told the answer over 20 times. Asking where my baby is when I‚Äôve told her over 3 times on one phone call.)

-Has been hospitalized twice due to depression/alcohol and suicidal ideation 

-Went to a mental facility the first time 

-Turned to alcohol and was hiding it from everyone (made everything worse)

-Lied constantly while drinking and still don‚Äôt know if she is or isn‚Äôt lying about things or if she genuinely thinks she‚Äôs telling the truth but isn‚Äôt 

-Continues to lie about certain things or hide certain things. Will also fake or act being extremely happy and it‚Äôs weird bec I‚Äôm like just an hour ago or yesterday you were hysterical and things don‚Äôt just turn around and get better like that 

-Went to detox and now in a type of AA/therapy where they meet 3 times a week for 3 hours 

-She is on anxiety and depression medication (clearly not helping)

-Barely eats

-Disrupted sleep / sleeps a lot

-Loss of memory / Doesn‚Äôt remember full conversations.
We FaceTime every day and I showed her a room that I turned into my babies playroom the next day she had no memory or this.

She told me over 7 times that someone dropped an extra lawnmower off for us at her house because I mentioned that ours sucked and she told that person. She repeated the story of this person dropping off the lawnmower and continued to tell me and has no memory of telling me.

-Can‚Äôt/doesn‚Äôt take care of herself 

-Literally can no longer function and normal everyday things that people do is to much for her

-Can‚Äôt work has been fired repeatedly 

-Doesn‚Äôt even know how to ‚Äúlook‚Äù for a job anymore

-Won‚Äôt/Can‚Äôt look for therapy for mental illness so I am having to end up doing that for her even though I will talk about it until I‚Äôm blue in the face. She says she wants to get better but won‚Äôt do anything to get herself there. Sent her places directly that accept Medicaid bec before her excuse was that no one accepts Medicaid so I found them all for her. Then says that she contacted them and they don‚Äôt accept Medicaid.  So I‚Äôll contact them and they do.

-Selling her house bec she won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt work and has no money 

-Knowing she is selling her house, accepted an offer she has no where to live and hasn‚Äôt looked for a place. Will say no one takes animals but with one google search you can find places that take animals. Wants someone to help her find a place 

-14 year old child in this situation but mainly staying with dad now and looks like she will have to move in with them due to not having a house and won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt put effort into looking for one. This situation is traumatic and toxic for everyone involved 

-Doesn‚Äôt respect any boundaries ever. I just had a baby and I‚Äôm constantly being pulled away or he is having to listen to calls of this. Even if I say I can‚Äôt talk right now bec we are out she will says okay and call back two seconds later over and over and over again

-I talk to her every day sometimes up to 4 times a day or hour plus long conversations so this isn‚Äôt a lack of me not being available 

-If I have any feelings at all of getting burnt out from this I‚Äôm still postpartum and no one to lean on (this is someone who should be there for me regularly and not the other way around) I am in fear she will kill herself

-If I try to set any boundaries she assumes I hate her and I fear she will kill herself or I‚Äôll make it worse 

-If I‚Äôm out and she‚Äôs having an episode she will continue to call me over and over and over despite me saying that I love her and just can‚Äôt talk right now she will do the same with my sibling if one of us can‚Äôt be contacted she bounces back and fourth between calling us 

-Hysterical daily 

-Next day will act completely fine

-Will send a video and be like this is so funny and two seconds later call hysterical 

-Facts presented do not matter to her when she has something in her head her ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù about it are fact 

-Does 180s (one day her kid is terrible and awful to her the next day he is the best kid in the entire world) 

-Can not trust or believe much of anything she says 

-Makes very poor decisions with money. Can‚Äôt afford her house yet will try to send me $200 bec I mention I need clothes. We will essentially argue by me trying to explain to her how irresponsible this is and she can‚Äôt afford to do this and that I‚Äôm not taking her money and I‚Äôll send it back to her. In this state she will also try to randomly offer my sibling money. I don‚Äôt know if this is a subconscious way of self sabotage or what 

-Does not parent her child, although she thinks she takes really good care of him. She does not see how his behavior is a direct impact of how traumatic this all is for him and acts like the victim by him. He‚Äôs only 14.

-She will tell me she sleeps all day and doesn‚Äôt know how to look for a job and can‚Äôt work etc. I tell her that her sons dad should have full custody and that this isn‚Äôt okay to put him through and she doesn‚Äôt understand why I would say that or why he should be taken from her

-The next day I will say, with you sleeping all day and she will say I don‚Äôt sleep all day and I‚Äôm like you are the one who told me that 

-Yesterday she has a huge breakdown and she sent me a sort of suicidal message so I started calling her a ton. We FaceTimed and she was hysterical. At one point after her calming down I had asked her if she had ate today. She said no and then eventually said she had a cheese stick and some chips. After 10 min of convincing her she needs to eat and we were going over what she has in the house she looked in a cupboard and said she has muffins. I said great okay eat that. She said okay and close the cupboard but didn‚Äôt take anything out. She was just sitting there and after a minute I said are you going to get the muffin and she said I am (while doing nothing) I continued to watch her not do anything so I was confused and said no you‚Äôre not. She continued to sit there and then looked directly at me in the camera and said YES I AM. While again doing nothing. I said what do you mean you are just sitting there. She sat there a second longer and then got back in the cupboard and grabbed it 

I really am struggling with this. If anyone has any advice on what this could be or what else I can do to help please please let me know. Thank you

1lmrzva,MentalHealthSupport,"I'm struggling to cope, between material losses and memories of school bullying","Hello everyone,

I feel the need to talk about this somewhere. These last few months have been very difficult for me. I experienced an accidental fire at home two months ago. I managed to avoid the worst, but I lost a large part of my belongings, including my laptop, my camera, and some puppets I had created for my art studies.

These objects weren't just material; they were linked to my recovery. Since elementary and middle school, I've suffered constant harassment: insults, physical violence, isolation... and this has left me with chronic anxiety. I recently developed chronic gastritis, so I rarely go out, and my social anxiety is severe. I had found some solace in photography and artistic creation, and their loss has been very hard to take.

1f3g6xi,MentalHealthSupport,Memory Loss with GAD?,"I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and a Panic Attack Disorder a few months ago. I see both my general physician and a therapist regularly. Sometimes my panic attacks are so severe I faint for a few seconds. 
I  taking the highest dosage of Celexa and then Xanex to manage the attacks. 
The Celexa has helped some but not 100% so this next week is my last weekly trying it before I try something else. 
Something happened Monday that I literally have no explanation for. I was at the beach with friends and we did a big group boat excursion. We all were having some drinks but nothing major. I‚Äôm good with monitoring my intake since I‚Äôm on meds. 
A random guy told his wife that I said something rude to him while we were all out in the water and I know I did not. I spoke to the guy while in front of his wife for maybe 15 mins and went on my way to hang with my friends. Here‚Äôs where things went off the rails: apparently when my friends tried to warn me that this guy said something I got very upset which is understandable. Someone accusing you of something you did not do. Once we are on the boat, I have zero memory of what I said or did. Which apparently I was asking this guy what exactly he thinks I did and being very loud. 
I. Do. Not. Remember. This. 
I was not drunk -in fact when we got back to the condo I checked my drink and it was still half full. I was not having a panic attack either. And I remember everything else that happened once we got to the condo. 
About an hour later I actually did end up having a panic attack and passed out from frankly the distress, confusion and fear of what had happened. Did my GAD like short circuit my brain? Is it my medication is wrong?  Am I losing it. I‚Äôve been scared of myself since. Has this happened to anyone. 
Anyone who knows me know, I‚Äôm not someone who would go at someone or say anything offensive. Especially while having a ball in the ocean. 
This is scaring me so bad, I‚Äôm having my therapist schedule some hypnosis for me so I can get some answers. Sorry for the novel but desperate for some answers. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1f3g6xi/memory_loss_with_gad/,1724866370.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

nkakld,Stress,Recent events have killed what little motivation I had. Now I'm just sick due to stress.,"15 years ago, my life was miserable. My depression and anxiety were out of control. I was diagnosed with a potentially deadly rare genetic disorder, as well as IBD and Fibromyalgia. I lost so much weight I would cry when I saw myself in a mirror, my mother would cry when she saw me too. And my marriage was falling apart.

My wife left my to fend for myself and I lived alone for a year. In that year I built myself back up, got my health issue's (mental and physical) under control, and blossomed. But I was still just existing, not truly living. So I did the most spontaneous thing I've ever done, and moved across country, leaving everyone and everything behind.

Moving across country was the best decision I've ever made. I was healthier than I'd been in years, I was enjoying my life, doing things I'd never thought I'd do. In short, I was happy and living my best life. But good things don't last forever.

A few years later I moved back because of family issues and some emotional manipulation on their part. I came home to chaos and was instantly thrown back into the hell I had left. But they, my family, got what they wanted so they didn't really care what it cost me emotionally and physically. But, I still had hope I could do or be something more, I still had dreams.

But that was 6 years ago. Slowly my dreams dwindled away and my hope was dying, but I still tried to hang on to that, until today.

For the last month I've been strapped for money because of some ridiculousness. I've been fighting for weeks to get it back, and finally I got it back today. But there was a problem, because why wouldn't there be. After all that fighting to get my money back, my bank has decided to hold it for 3 to 7 business days. The timing couldn't be more unfortunate. 

I'm on disability, I get paid one a month, and everything I have goes to paying bills. But because of the issues with my money this month, I haven't been able to pay all my bills. Fortunately I got a small loan to pay my cellphone bill and borrowed money to pay my rent. But what I could not do was pay anything else, and right now that's a huge problem. 

My niece lives with me and I pay the cable/internet bill. She is doing distance learning and, obviously, need internet access to go to school. Earlier this month I got an extension for the internet service, but now it's due tomorrow. See what I mean about unfortunate timing. But no one will help me and I'm lost. I had to send my niece to my mother's just so she could go to school. But my mother doesn't need the extra hassle, her life is stressful enough as it is.

But all of this has taken a toll on me and today has just broken me. Because of the intense stress for the last month, my eczema has flared up on my face, where I've never had it before. My fibromyalgia and IBS have both flared up. I'm just sick to my stomach and I just want to curl up and sleep forever. After all that fighting, my bank is the one that broke me. 

I can't take anymore stress or I'm going to end up in the hospital. But that looks like what my immediate future is going to be.

But, anyway, thanks for letting me vent. I wish I could say I feel better, but I don't. I feel withered up inside and have no more faith or trust in humanity.

13py9it,Stress,Chronic stress and anxiety: burning skin.,"Hello,

I hope you all are doing okay! I come here to try and ask a question... 

Has anyone here ever been so chronically stressed that your skin is super sensitive for long periods of time? I'm going through a really stressful time in my life, and after having several panic attacks I've noticed that my skin on my abdomen, especially in the front on my belly is extra sensitive throughout the day, and wearing even a cotton tee shirt feels like sandpaper. It kind of always feels like a mild sunburn going on there. I'll say that there's no fibromyalgia going on, or nerve issues. But, it onset during a panic attack in my car on a road trip a while back, like 5 or so months ago. The funny thing is that it seems to go away when I exercise or am at a deep rest, like having just ate a large tasty meal and digesting on the couch watching a good movie. 

I'm aware that chronic stress can cause all kinds of skin issues, and it has for me for a long time by making my face crack and peel when I'm super antsy, like before or during a big event with lots of people involved. This seems to worsen for several days and then get better when I'm not worried so much. But the only difference here is that I've had panic attacks now, and I've been out over the edge and fell into a deep state of depersonalization, which is exacerbating my stress levels to extremes, so much so that my brain is cutting off my emotions to try and cope, like an airbag, which is extremely unsettling. 

I'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced this and, if so, what you did about it or if it got better once the stress levels died down.

Anxiety isn‚Äôt just racing thoughts. ¬†It‚Äôs also jaw tension, shoulder bracing, stomach flips, shaky legs‚Ä¶the body prepping for a threat that never quite arrives. That‚Äôs why somatic therapy matters. It speaks the body‚Äôs language, instead of telling your system it‚Äôs safe, it **shows** it, repeatedly. **This isn‚Äôt about being calm, it‚Äôs about having range.** To feel the activation of tension without being ruled by it by having control.¬† Here are a few examples to try:

* Press your hands into a wall. Let your muscles tremble. Then stop. That‚Äôs teaching your system: ‚ÄúI can ramp up and come down.‚Äù
* Track sensations. Tight jaw, hot face, chest pressure‚Ä¶ without assigning meaning. You‚Äôre observing it, not decoding it.
* Sway side to side. Shift your weight, your left foot, then right foot. Tiny movements build flexibility and flexibility lowers panic.

It‚Äôs not magic, it‚Äôs mechanics, and over time, your system starts to trust that safety is a repeatable state and not just a fluke. Somatic work isn‚Äôt a replacement for therapy.

1l2zuwj,Stress,"Why ""Relaxing"" Feels Like Hell When You Have Anxiety","For people with anxiety, ‚Äújust relax‚Äù isn‚Äôt a suggestion‚Ä¶t‚Äôs a threat. Relaxing requires surrender of control of hyper-vigilance, of the mental scaffolding you‚Äôve built to hold your world in place. And when you finally set those defenses down, the mind doesn‚Äôt slip into ease. It often opens the floodgates. This is the paradox: peace is not peaceful when your body associates stillness with danger. You lie down, and the thoughts come faster, so you take a bath, and your heart races. You go on vacation and spend the entire time imagining how you‚Äôll die on the way home. To the uninitiated, we will call them the non-anxious, this seems baffling. You look fine. You‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù You have no reason to be afraid. But anxiety doesn‚Äôt require a reason, It only requires a body, a memory, and enough quiet to get a word in. Loved ones, even the kindest, often stumble here. They offer comfort that assumes logic, as if fear could be reasoned with. As if the real miracle isn‚Äôt just surviving normal life when your nervous system is wired for catastrophe. If this is you, know this: there is nothing wrong with how you‚Äôre built. But healing isn‚Äôt just about finding calm, it‚Äôs about teaching your body that calm is safe. And that, like most profound things, will take time.

‚ÄúI am tomorrow, or some future day, what I establish today. I am today what I established yesterday or some previous day.‚Äù

1ljxskp,Stress,First panic attack?,"I have been under a stupid amount of stress going on three years now.  Troubles with spouse, an injury that was the result of a surgery that was supposed to improve my life but left me in chronic pain, caring for an 85yo mother which feels like a second job some days even though she's in care (and she was horribly abusive when I was a kid but I'm the only one left).  I also lost my sister, and former husband during this time, have to work long hours despite the chronic pain because my husband prioritizes possessions over all else, and well, I could go on.  

So today I wake up at 3:30am because pain usually doesn't let me sleep much.  Tried to get back to sleep til around 5:30, then decided I may as well get up and work.  Made a coffee and went to my desk downstairs.  By 10am I fugure I better move a bit as my back is seizing up.  I step outside to walk through the forest that is my property, hoping to get a moment of zen. My boss sends a text message while I'm walking asking for a meeting, and then I'm getting another message from mom asking me to buy her groceries (she is in a care home but apparently their food isn't good enough).  

I just lost my shit.  I started to shake uncontrollably from head to toe, my heart was racing and I couldn't think straight.  I could barely stand I was shaking so hard.  I just leaned against a tree and tried my best to slow down the breathing til I finally gained enough control to be able to walk back to the house.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  Is this what a panic attack feels like?  I don't know what else would trigger something like this but wow, my brain was in a fog for hours afterwards, and even on the call with the boss I was still shaking and having trouble speaking. My day only got worse from there, but thankfully that was the only episode.

     So I get there and clock on, say my hellos, start working and then I go into our office that Head Cashiers and managers use. I'm filling out some paperwork in there and trying to control my breathing by doing deep breaths. Then the breathing kinda gets weird and I'm hyperventilating.  So I crouch down and lean on some cabinets and it's getting worse and worse and can feel tears coming out and my hands and arms are tingling alot. I'm yelling for help but looking back it probably just sounded like wails. I was able to get my phone out and tap to call someone and they come in and help me get my breathing controlled, tell me to take it slow, someone called out, etc. So finally I'm back on my feet and doing some more tasks and then decided to go home. 

     This was all within an hour of being there. I know the managers and coworkers are upset I left early but, I'm still shaken up and tired and didn't want to deal with customer service. When I think of how upset they are the tightness starts to come back. My jobs not hard, nothing ""triggered "" it, I just kind of freaked out ig. I've never had that happen. I'm so embarrassed to go back. I was supposed to have 3 days off after closing tonight, but since I left an hour after I started what if everyone thinks I faked it to get 4 days off??

18us58d,Stress,Panic attacks and losing hope,"Hi everyone,

  
I started having panic attacks one year ago when I was in a really high-pressure engineering school while living abroad and alone at 18 years old. I quit that school due to horrible mental and emotional abuse from teachers and the extreme amount of stress, and returned to my country. 

  
I was quickly diagnosed with panic disorder, and had the most horrible panic attacks every single day for months. I did counselling and a couple of sessions of EMDR therapy for six months. Now it's been one year, and I went to study abroad again and changed my degree, but after all this therapy, I'm still experiencing panic attacks. 

  
Even though they're not as frequent (once every 1-2 weeks) and not as intense as they were before, I am so exhausted from battling with this. I still have horrible anxious thoughts and nights where I cannot breathe and feel like I'm dying. 

  
I am starting to lose hope that this disease will ever go away. I am so scared and getting depressed and hopeless, and the fact that I'm alone in a foreign country is not helping. 

  
I was wondering if it's possible to fully recover from a panic disorder, and to not have panic attacks and live a happy life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/18us58d/panic_attacks_and_losing_hope/,1703976553.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A question for those who feel they‚Äôve been experiencing chronic stress for a long time, which is already manifesting physically: inability to fully relax, sleep problems, headaches, etc.  
Do you think there was a specific point in your life when ""everything started to break down""?  

What I mean is, we aren‚Äôt born in a state of stress. So, up until a certain point (youth, perhaps?), we live relatively normally‚Äîable to truly relax, rest, sleep well, with emotions in check, etc. But at some point, something starts to go wrong. And from that moment, things only get worse and worse.  

So, the question is‚Äîwas there a specific turning point for you? Or was there no single moment, and the stress just built up gradually until it became overwhelming?

It takes me forever to get ready - I would much rather be doing anything else in the morning, and i uber most days even though I can't afford it, and even ubering I'm late most days.

I can barely focus for longer than 20-30 minutes at a time and need to take a break between each task. 

Social plans feel like a chore, I have no desire to even though I'm usually a person with a packed schedule. The thought of doing anything other than staying home and working on my new place (recently moved out of an emotionally draining environment) fills me with deep unhappiness, and i have to really hype myself up to do it.

I usually care so much about my job and clients and it is what has kept me going but I cannot muster any energy around it, something that filled me with such purpose now fills me with apathy. Im just doing things on autopilot now.

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing this because I don't really know where else to turn, and I‚Äôm feeling pretty desperate for some advice and support.

Lately, I've been feeling incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out. It seems like no matter what I do, I can‚Äôt shake this constant feeling of anxiety and depression. I've been struggling to keep up with my responsibilities, both at work and in my personal life, and it‚Äôs all starting to take a serious toll on my mental health.

To give some context, I'm balancing multiple demanding projects at work while also trying to find a new job. The pressure to succeed is immense, and I'm constantly worried about failing or not being good enough. My perfectionism only makes things worse, as I often feel like I need to excel in everything I do.

On top of all this, I‚Äôm trying to learn new skills and grow professionally, which adds another layer of stress. It feels like there‚Äôs always something more to do and never enough time to do it. The weight of all these responsibilities is just so heavy.

I don‚Äôt have many people to talk to about how I‚Äôm feeling. It‚Äôs hard to open up about just how much I‚Äôm struggling right now. I'm finding it hard to sleep, my appetite is all over the place, and I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I try to take breaks and practice self-care, but it never feels like enough. The feelings of hopelessness are overwhelming.

1k4jl7l,Stress,Incredibly worried about my mom's stress/memory issues,"Hi all...I (42, f) am deeply concerned about my mom right now, and I guess I just need to know if what she's experiencing truly is related to her current stress/anxiety levels. My mom is in her mid 60s. About 6 months ago, her mom (my grandma) had to have emergency heart surgery and was moved into a nursing home.

My mom has been saddled with all the details of navigating my grandma's care/bills/legal paperwork/etc. Her brother refuses to help with any of the day to day. To add to it, my mom feels incredibly guilty that her mom is now in assisted living. Mentally, my grandma is completely sound, so...she calls my mother like 20 times a day to guilt trip her about leaving her at a nursing home. My mom also spends upwards of 15 hours a week visiting my grandma. 

Ever since this whole thing started, it's like I've lost 80% of my mom. We live about 600 miles apart, but we're very close and we speak on the phone daily. She went from being extremely on top of her game to like...dementia levels of forgetfulness basically overnight. She can't remember what she did yesterday. She can't remember the plot of a TV show she just watched. She'll tell me the same thing multiple times because she forgot she already told me. And a few days ago, she asked me if my partner was back at his apartment or visiting me for the weekend......even though he moved in with me 4 months ago. 

It's incredibly scary and it's freaking me out. My dad and brother have both called to tell me how worried they are. When I broach the subject, she cries because she knows it's happening but is so stressed, she doesn't know how to fix it. She also pretty much never sleeps a full night, which I'm sure is contributing. She has a rx for Lunesta but refuses to take it because she doesn't want to become ""addicted.""

I don't know what to do. I truly don't think it's alzheimers or dementia. She is handling all my grandma's accounts, taxes, paperwork, bills, etc and doing fine with it. She REFUSES to write things down to help her remember, instead choosing to keep a constantly running list in her head of everything that needs to be done. I feel like she's martyring herself and sacrificing her mental and physical health and there's nothing I can do to help her learn to manage her stress. 

Is memory loss/insane brain fog a symptom of this level of stress?? She refuses to talk to her doctor because she knows he will tell her she has to find a way to cope, and she's worried he'll put her on medication. 

I insisted to her that we take our annual fishing trip in a few weeks, and she has agreed to go. I'm terrified that I won't even recognize her. 

How would you handle this?? It's making *me* anxious and stressed on top of everything else I'm dealing with in my personal life. I guess this is partially a vent and partially me looking for stories from ppl who have experienced a similar situation.

In ancient Chinese culture and ancient Indian culture, they observed that when activated, this can cause a few physical reactions like controlling your temperature, dilating your pupils, controlling your heartbeat, perspiration, smiling, teary eyes, flooding yourself with euphoria or activating in certain parts of your body and of course goosebumps.

This soothing subtle energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli, with just the simple intention of experiencing it.

gwfjq3,Stress,Dealing with stress the Indian way - With ayurveda," Stress is basically an inbuilt mechanism in our body for a flight or fright situation. It is a reaction to a threat or a similar demanding situation. The stress response is the body‚Äôs way of protecting you. When on point, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert.¬†

For example, it is the stress hormones that makes you hit the brakes at the nick of the time to avoid a car accident.

There is no denying the positive effects of stress. It can also help you rise to meet challenges. It‚Äôs what keeps you on your toes during an important day at work, to sharpen your concentration when you study for an exam instead of watching TV.¬†

But like most things, beyond a certain point, stress starts causing major damage to your health, mood, productivity, relationships, and your quality of life.

You can protect yourself from such ill effects and improve how you think and feel by learning how to recognize the signs and symptoms of chronic stress and taking steps to reduce its harmful effects.

 **What happens in stressful situations?**

The hypothalamus in the brain sends out a signal to the adrenal glands above the kidneys which leads to the secretion of adrenaline and stress hormone cortisol.

Liver produces more blood sugar after recognising the body‚Äôs need for energy.

Our fight or flight response is very useful during physical danger. You feel pumped and more equipped to counter the situation. However, during emotionally stressful times, there is hardly any outlet for the body to utilise this energy.

**How does it affect?**

Chronic stress due to strained relationships or overworking could alter the brain and change its function. It increases the activity level of the Amygdala ‚Äì your brain‚Äôs emotional center and Hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for learning, deteriorates.

This could lead to more serious mental problems such as depression and even Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Ways to counter stress:

* Regular exercise.
* Yoga.¬†¬†
* Make time to have fun and relax.
* Cut down on caffeine, alcohol, energy drinks and sugar consumption.
* Get quality sleep
* Transcendental Meditation.¬†
* Being Organised will help counter your stress. Try maintaining a checklist and keeping things in order.

**A herb like Ashwagandha would also help in keeping cortisol levels in check. It‚Äôs classified as an adaptogen, as it‚Äôs clinically proven to help your body manage stress better.**

Our Brain is like a Muscle, the more we flex the better it becomes.  

Overthinking and underthinking are equally bad for our Brain. 

In Australia where I live, we have an ageing population now. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease ranks 1 and 2. Unfortunately there is no permanent cure available for these diseases. 

I taught an autistic lady on how to activate her creative brain and that rekindled her passion for dance and drama at 45! 

Glucose is the chief source of fuel for the Brain.  When you feel low on Brain power, a little candy or lolly might help!

155nobn,Stress,Family history of dementia and I'm afraid of eventually suffering the same fate,"I have a family history of dementia on my dad's side. Though, it seems it was largely stress induced (which i mean, makes some sense). My grandpa (95) is very far gone into dementia- had multiple strokes in his life and ptsd from ww2 + generally a rough life. His brother, whos even older (96), is in amazing condition and was still driving himself around and doing work around the house until about half a year ago. He is still very sharp and aware. My dad was a heavy alcoholic and abused prescriptions, and very obviously has nerve and brain damage from years of doing this. I have also watched my mom work herself half to death and family drama of both sides has been absolutely insane over the years.

The effects of chronic stress are evident in most my family members, both physically and mentally. I want to learn better stress management skills and avoid such health issues and mental deterioration as I can helpm But it's hard.

I have somewhat lofty goals. With school- Im an undergrad getting 2 majors and a minor + working on a research project that will be published im so excited like what??!). I am in my senior year now. Im hoping to go to grad school and pursuing a masters or ohd in linguistics. Im also working during this time. I travel semi often (currently studying abroad). Money does cause stress and Im working on dealijg with some very very old trauma and a resulting pain condition (if youre wondering, i made this acct for discovering said conditions and u can look at my post hist i guess). I also have a lot of hobbies but only really do art at the moment. I had a small issue with drinking that I recently nipped in the bud. I try to work out and eat better more oftwn but I just feel so burned out so often that i dont often do so (its been slowly getting a lil better tho!). I have a pretty bad sleep schedule thats been hard to fix.

I have some anxiety, moderate ocd, and pretty bad perfectionism.

I'm not sure how much of this is paranoia vs actual things I'm noticing, but I think I'm beginning to reach the point where stress might have long term effects on ny health.

Ive always had a bad social memory but I feel like my memory generally has been getting worse lately. This last winter and spring, I averaged like 6 hours of sleep a night and was living off of energy drinks (i try to get 0 sugar always, but i know thats not exactly healthy- its just bad in a slightly diff way...). I started getting mild heart palpations (which ive been more prone to every since o got them a lot during a hiiighly steessful period in high school). I was at work one day, after finally presenting a large project at my uni's synposium of undergrad reaearch, and I felt like I couldnt breathe randomly. I waited it out, and it lasted like an hr. It was kinda scary. I probably should have brought it up or sought some kind of medical attention but I didnt. Since then, I've tried to cut way down on caffine.

I have had a relatively stressful childhood, teenhood, and now young adulthood. I havent had a real break since starting college, as even in summers I end up travelling a lot and/or also doing summer classes.

I have been hella burned out a whilw now.

I want to find ways to manage stress better while also not giving up my goals. I want to still travel. I want my 2 degrees (and Im super close to having both anyways now). I want to do this project bc im so passionate about it. And i want to still have fun and do my hobbies.

Its just... so much sometimes.

1f5x368,Stress,Memory issues for the past few years,"Wasn't sure where to post this. When I search memory issues, there are many subs with topics about it.

After the pandemic I took a new position at my employer. I'm a bit older and thought a career change would be good. Especially after doing the same thing for so long. In the end, it wasn't a good change. I was really stressed to the point I hated life and I felt stuck. I have a wife and kids that depend on me financially, so I couldn't just quit. I did the job for about a year. I was looking at other jobs and ended up in another position at the same company.

During the time I was stressed out, there were many days I thought of ending my life. It was miserable. I was constantly ruminating on whether I was going to lose my job and whether I would be able to provide for my family. I couldn't think about anything else. Side note, I have pretty bad anxiety. I've taken meds for it about 13 years. I had weaned off them for a while, but ended back on a low dose of Lexapro to take the edge off. 

After all that and starting a new position, I have felt like my memory is off. I have a hard time recalling things and remembering things. It's not that I cannot remember anything, I can remember new things. But it seems that I have to put in more energy than I used to. Recall is worse. Forgetting names, mainly of actors or people I don't see daily. On reality it seems normal, but I cannot seem to get over it. I ruminate on it and cannot seem to stop worrying about it. 

Out of fear, I stopped drinking coffee, mainly because it would cause anxiety. I stopped drinking. I used to drink a lot. Mainly because I was not satisfied with life. I've started riding a peloton at least three days a week. I've started eating better. I started meditating a few years ago. I need to get back to doing that more. I've started prioritizing sleep. I also use a CPAP machine now. Turns out I have obstructive sleep apnea. Oh, and I started using red light therapy on my head. 

I've basically been doing anything I can to take better care of myself. I've had my good days and bad. I just want to feel normal again. This week has been a little difficult. My brain feels a little like mush. I keep wondering if I have early dementia. I don't think I do, but the mind tends to go to worst case scenarios.

Anyway, I just needed to write about it. It weighs on me nearly everyday. I think the stress is likely the real culprit. The meditation seems to help. I also need to be more compassionate with myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1f5x368/memory_issues_for_the_past_few_years/,1725137137.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

My husband is 35 male, fit and healthy. Never had any previous medical issues and isn‚Äôt on any drugs and a non smoker.

Over the past couple of weeks he has started to forget things and he is really worried about it. He couldn‚Äôt remember the name of our sons old school (I would say a tricky thing to remember at times) but the worst one was he couldn‚Äôt remember the road near our house for about an hour the other day.

1eq2sn8,Stress,"My Story, CPTSD and Chronic Stress Symptoms, Improvement, Treatment, VERY VALUABLE INSIGHTS that can help YOU too, VERY IMPORTANT + Question : How does Exercise (Cardio, Lifting Weights) Help treat Anxiety, Chronic Stress and the Constant Fight-Or-Flight State ? ","Hello r/Stress community, I'm making this post here because it covers a lot of mental health disorders (CPTSD, chronic stress, tension, anxiety, fight-or-flight, etc) and it can be very helpful and useful to anyone. I also would like more information and help for myself and others but for the most part I want to share what has worked for me so far.

As the title says, I also want to know exactly how exercise really helps here, I went to the gym and I'll share my personal thoughts below, but I want to know what anyone else thinks and knows about why exercise helps here with these issues, as well as any other non-exercise-related advice that they can give and share.

**The Story**

So, I will first share my story, i am M24 and I have been through a traumatic event over one year ago after being a victim of ID theft & fraud, a loan of ¬£25,000 was fraudulently taken in my name by identity fraudsters from a bank they scammed and I developed trauma, stress, tension, anxiety and a constant fight-or-flight from this. Interestingly I was far more hurt by the bank and it's cutthroat treatment of me more than anything else, I'm sure the bankers knew all too well that they're in the wrong but they insisted on hurting me anyway as much as they could and try to hold me liable by force, my personal experience was that they were corrupt and ruthless themselves, this left some serious mental scars on me. The whole matter was pretty much resolved though (see my other posts on my personal profile), every party involved turned their back against the bank and sided with me including Debt Collectors and the Finacial Ombudsman, everyone knows the bank was full of crap, but the bank infuriated me a lot because of how unfairly it was treating me with no remorse, and it made me go into full-blown war mode in the conflicts I had with it.


**The Symptoms**

The symptoms I developed are varied but in April of 2023 when the conflict began they started as stress, agitation, restlessness, tiredness, fatigue, a sensation of conflict and lack of safety and comfort, before July of 2023 when the conflict with the bank got more intense and the fight-or-flight mode instantly switched on and stress hormones flooded my body.

Then in July of 2023, one day the fight-or-flight switched on and I had a sudden and rapid onset of extreme headaches, head pressure sensations, tension headaches with moving sensations, head pulsations and pounding (which was strong enough to physically make my head move with the pulsations, sleeping was very difficult, these pulsations felt like my heart was beating at the back of my head), sensations of pain akin to fybromialgia in my teeth, jaw, around my eye sockets and on my skull bones (my whole face was hurting with pain), a feeling of extreme rage (I'm talking about a Viking Berserker's Rage type of rage. A rage so extreme it consumed all, I avoided being around people for months because of how scared I was by the intensity of the rage and how easily anything would irritate me, and when I would be alone at home I would roar in rage a few times to release it, if not I would punch a pillow. Very unusual, I think this was part of the primal fight-or-flight response to prepare me for a fight with a stronger adversary, like a bear or a tiger. My conflict with the bank certainly felt to me like I was in a fight with a strong enemy) and lots of physical energy and strength (from excess adrenaline and cortisol), rapid uncontrollable heart beats and high blood pressure, tinnitus, brain zaps, hot sweats that felt like my body and head were burning, extreme restlessness and insomnia, bodily pain, an urge to stretch my body and jaw in response to the tension, dizziness (feeling like the room spins around me), constant irritability and negativity, initially I had a weird sensation of strong sexual arousal (due to the stress hormones initial effect) which subsided and then made me suffer from E.D. and lack of libido, inability to think clearly and deeply, inability to concentrate and focus, loss of cognitive proficiency, IBS symptoms (which at first really confused me as I never had such issues ever and I was scared of what was happening to my body), my state of stress became Chronic, a constant fight-or-flight state (from Sympathetic Nervous System Hyperarousal), and a whole lot of other terrible symptoms.
Emotionally I was revolted with rage, next up I then felt a lot of emotional and physical pain, next then I was feeling fear and panic, and I finally became stuck in a mixed state of constant revolt and conflict as well as panic, fear, anxiety and worry.
These symptoms I listed here have all persisted for about 4-5 months in combination before they began to improve noticeably.

(As you can see, I had all of the symptoms under the sun associated with stress, tension, trauma, anxiety and fight-or-flight, and I even had them all at once in July of 2023 which was terrible enough)


**The Improvements**

Thankfully, after more than a year, about half of these issues disappeared, and all the other ones had improved, yet some are still stuck and I still need improvement to get back to normal.
My mind and body are still not balanced enough, I haven't attained complete homeostasis and the Parasympathetic Nervous System is not yet half as activated as it should be, while the Sympathetic Nervous System is still at least half-active.
Symptoms that stick around are the head pulsations (which decreased in intensity, but still continue), a few minor headaches, my neck and back of my head makes cracking and snapping noises often, my heart beats a bit more rapidly than normal (although not as rapidly as it did before), I have apathy, I feel like a shell of my former self (Very far from who I was before all of these events, no joy, no happiness, no pleasure, no humour, no motivation), I have E.D. and lack of libido (although my E.D. improved a little bit in time, still I'm not back to normal), some digestive and IBS issues persist but in a mild and reduced way (I understood that IBS is caused by stress, when blood flow isn't traveling to the stomach as much, as the body's focus is shifted towards survival mode. Overtime as the stress fades, the body's regular functions recover), a lingering state of fight-or-flight and generally some lack of a sense of comfort, of safety, and my mind mistrusts that I can ever feel safe again, it's like it is always expecting for something bad to happen at anytime and it remains on high alert so that it is never taken by surprise. It's like it always expects something bad to happen next and it doesn't want to have its guard down. 
I understand that these reactions are my body's mechanism of protecting me, and funnily enough I experienced a bit more improvement when I understood that this was a good thing and I became a bit more thankful towards my body when I understood that it did all of this to keep me safe from what it perceived as danger. But at the same time, this is clearly a misconception of my body that needs to be rectified. Nonetheless, understanding that your body is working FOR YOU and not against you is a good thing to do.

(As you can see, I understood very well overtime how my mind and body reacted, why they reacted like they did, and all the underlying details. I hope this at least also provides some helpful information for those who suffer from those symptoms and are baffled by what's really going on as I was. When such conditions strike, we freak out over what's going on with our bodies because we don't understand why they react the way that they do)


**The Solutions**

I have taken many approaches to restore myself, within the last 3-4 months I managed to really improve compared to how I was one year ago. I understood that a holistic and comprehensive approach is in order to really get the solution that I seek, so these approaches include : 

**1. - Doing Therapy** - I followed 3 different therapy programmes with 3 different therapy services, 2 of them focused on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and one was specifically for Overcoming Low Mood. This was very helpful and helped change my way of thinking, processing,  interpreting and perceiving into a more healthier way.

**2. - Socialising -** At first I became secluded from the world and avoidant of people, but I began to socialise and find social groups where I can engage with people. These really helped cleanse my mind and my experience of the world and brought in a fresh sense of positivity and human connection which helped move my mind away from my troubles and make me more engaged with the world. Socialising helps take us out of our own minds and brings us back into the flow and rhythm of the world around us, which is as things should normally be.

I realised quickly that we need to connect with people in order to move on from trauma, when we suffer from trauma, we suffer from being stuck in a loop where our thoughts are laser-focused on the negative event. And we cannot move on because we do not allow ourselves to connect with people and create fresh new positive memories that can replace the negative impact of the bad memories. 
I was stubborn at first, and didn't really want to socialise with anyone, but that was an error of my own wounded mind, the truth is we are human beings designed to connect with others and socialise, and trauma can be overriden and rendered meaningless once you make enough positive memories and experiences to wash it away. With enough good memories and experiences to counter trauma, you dilute the trauma.

**3. - Meditation -** I began to meditate in nature, I would go to a park nearby and just sit on the grass with eyes closed and pay attention to my other senses without thinking about anything at all. This was and still is a challenge because my mind got so used to being stressed and devoid of concentration, but I do it anyway. This is very good and makes me feel slightly better each time.

Engaging in meditation requires adapting a state of peace and calm, even if it must be forced a bit. Calmness is oftentimes overlooked, but it is the first thing that we lose in dealing with mental issues, and usually the last thing we tend to think about. So getting that calmness and peace back helps bring us back more to our normal selves and natural way of being.

**4. - Deep Breathing -** I began to breathe deeply through my diaphragm, which initially was very difficult to do as my body was by default rushing my breaths and trying to breathe through my chest due to being in a constant fight-or-flight which made it tough, but I persisted. Deep breathing helps activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is key to defeating fight-or-flight.
I use the 4-7-8 Deep Breathing method, where I breathe in through the nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and then breathe out through the mouth slowly for 8 seconds. 
I now set aside at least 15 minutes daily for deep breathing and for the 4-7-8 technique, and I breathe deeply anytime I remember to do it. I believe the real benefits come from engaging in deep breathing in a cumulative way, where everytime you breathe deeply, you adapt and accustom the mind and body to naturally breathe slowly and deeply unconsciously without needing your conscious effort any longer. This helps reset the breathing pattern back to normal permanently.

**5. - Taking Supplements -** I began to research the best supplements for combating chronic stress, anxiety, and fight-or-flight. After a lot of research, I began a routine of taking the following supplements daily : 
- Magnesium Citrate
- Calcium Citrate
- Zinc Citrate 
- Vitamin B-Complex
- Vitamin D 
- Gingko Biloba
- Probiotics
- Peppermint Oil Capsules

All of these supplements help to combat stress and anxiety in some way, they also help with hormones & other chemical processes in the body, as well as helping with other issues brought about by stress.
The catch with supplements is that you need to take them continuously for at least 2 or 3 months before you can fully notice their effects and benefits, but it is very worthwhile. You may feel benefits sooner than 2 or 3 months, but they are not a quick fix like you take a magnesium pill now and expect to be stress-free the next day, it doesn't work like that, this is a long-term strategy to change the chemical composition and processes in your body.

**6. - Positive Thinking and Optimism, as well as Stopping being Obsessed with the cause of my Trauma -** For a long time I was far too obsessed with my identity theft & fraud situation and the bank dispute than I wanted to admit to myself, I was stuck in daily a loop of obsession, constant spite and disgust towards the bank, constant worry, constant agitation, constant hurt. I was obsessing, ruminating, worrying and feeling sorry for myself 24/7.

Trauma doesn't improve unless we stop thinking obsessively about the things that traumatised us, and then when we no longer obsess, we can then take a much needed break and reset our mind. Following that, we can then voluntarily return to the memory of the traumatic event and think more clearly with a fresh mind and process what happened much better and in healthier ways and more objectively rather than subjectively and personally.
I eventually got sick of thinking about the same situation over and over again, as if I have nothing better to do with my life. Am I seriously reducing my whole entire existence to just obsessing over this crap, and letting it prevent me from moving on and living my life happily ? Letting this actually control my life and twist my future? I became sick of it once I realised what I was actually doing to myself for many months. So I managed to stop obsessing, and began to put the whole thing out of my mind and not let it trouble me with painful memories. I did this initially by intentionally ""distracting"" myself by socialising with people - when you're too busy interacting with people all the time, you don't have time to worry about what's on your mind. That's how I mentally moved away from my obsession for the first time.

After I managed to no longer obsess over this, I then changed the situation in my mind as being ""Unimportant"" and ""Irrelevant"". How? Simple ! I just knew that since I didn't do what the bank accused me of doing, there's no point in me stressing over it. My conscience is at peace because I know the truth that I did not take that fraudulent loan. So this is not a problem for me to worry about, but for the fraudsters and criminals who are the ones who did this! This is not a problem that was mine, but instead one that was forcefully and unfairly IMPOSED on me by the bank for me to have in an ATTEMPT to make me treat this problem as if it were mine, when it never was in the first place. This is not a problem that I have and neither that I should have. The bank tried to gaslight me all along because it was desperate to recoup its losses by any means necessary and from anyone, even if it was unethical to force a victim of ID theft & fraud to pay for what some criminals did. When I understood this basic fact, I knew this situation is nothing more than a momentary distraction in my life.

I further removed the effect of the trauma by being ignorant towards it. Why ignorant ? Because ignorance is BLISS !! Ignorance is what is needed in order to no longer let trauma affect us. Before this traumatic incident, I lived my life in blissful ignorance, and that's why I was so happy without a worry or care in the world. Therefore, in order to be happy again, we need to become blissfully ignorant towards the traumatic incidents that took our happiness away from us. This diffuses all of the pain that trauma tries to induce. When you ignore it, it loses it's effect on you.

Once I realised these things, something just clicked. 
But I took this further by adapting positive thinking and optimism. You know that a study revealed that 70% of the things we worry about never happen? I began to feel much more at ease knowing that nothing is as bad as I thought. When I had a clearer mind and understanding, I could also finally see that really there's nothing for me to be worried about, and I backed this up with palpable proof and evidence. All in all, I began to look at this seeming disaster as a somewhat of a positive thing rather than something that would destroy me and my life.

**7. - Exercise -** I began to hit the gym and exercise 3 days a week.
I do 30 minutes of Cardio running on the treadmill, sometimes I do even 45 minutes.
I alternate between running (at paces between 7.0 to 10.0) to walking (at paces between 4.0 to 5.5) at various intervals in order to push my body for a while, then let it calm down and relax a bit, then push it again, then let it relax a bit again, rinse and repeat until the session is finished. I also use an incline of 3.0 and sometimes 4.0, and I also try as much as I can to engage with diaphragmatic breathing throughout my Cardio session, I can't breathe as deeply or hold my breath while actively moving, but I try to consciously breathe through my diaphragm instead of my chest.
I also lift weights and use the gym machines afterwards for a full body workout. And yes I drink lots of protein shakes, they're indispensable.

I have read that exercise and in particular Cardio workouts help with overcoming stress, tension, anxiety and fight-or-flight. What happens during Cardio is the stress hormones become metabolised and then they get expelled from the body, this is one of the only reliable ways to really get rid of the stress hormones in large quantities I.e. actually set yourself free from stress.
Everything else and all other methods I listed do help as well, but exercise actually uses up the cortisol, adrenaline, etc other stress hormones that get stuck in the body and exercise is required to move them out and flush them out of the body. 

Some study I read (sorry dont remember exactly, need to look it up again) also has shown that people who suffered from PTSD/CPTSD who have done a 30 minute Cardio workout right before beginning their therapy sessions have had far less symptoms associated with trauma, and far better improvements in their therapy sessions as well as better results and outcomes with their trauma issues. So exercise is no joke.

Exercise also produces good hormones such as endorphins, and it also does produce some amounts of cortisol, but this happens in a controlled way and you burn far more cortisol off than you produce. And if you suffered from CPTSD, Chronic Stress, Anxiety and Fight-Or-Flight well then you know that your body is literally flooded with cortisol and adrenaline which you need to burn off. 
In turn and after about 3 months of constant Cardio, your body's physiology changes and your mind and body become more resilient to stress and you no longer feel the stress (from exercise or from any other source, including trauma) because you have forged your body through controlled exercise to adapt to stress and no longer be startled by it.

Finally, a good point someone else made elsewhere and a personal discovery of mine regarding combating Fight-Or-Flight through exercise is that when you do Cardio on the treadmill, you create a simulation of ""running away and escaping from a threat"", which helps to calm down the mind and body after the session is finished and overcome the Fight-Or-Flight trauma response. 
After the end of a successful Cardio treadmill session, your mind and body ""think"" that because they ran so much and now they ceased and can walk normally, that you have escaped from a threat, from danger, and that you are now safe. And then they begin to behave accordingly, calming you down and lowering the heart rate. 

I also believe that exercise is crucial to lowering the heart rate to a calm and steady rhythm, as opposed to the high heart rate associated with fight-or-flight. I think this occurs because at the end of strenuous exercise, the mind and heart NATURALLY slow down and chill out. Everytime you finish a workout session, the heart calms down a little more. Overtime this impresses upon the body a natural and calm state, and the mind and heart begin to ""remember"" how to calm down. After many months of exercise I think it is not surprising why the heart rate decreases generally to a calm heart rate.

Furthermore, what keeps Fight-Or-Flight in a state of constancy is the lack of movement, motion or deliberate action to shake it off. The body stays stuck with tension thinking that it has to do something urgently to recover safety but it doesn't know what to do, this creates a tension where the muscles in the body get frozen between ""engaged"" and ""disengaged"", all of that tension needs to be released somehow and exercise is the best and possibly the only reliable way to do it. We suffer from tension and fight-or-flight because we need to put our body in motion and release all of that tension there for it to be relieved and satisfied that it has done something to avert danger, and then it can begin to behave normally again.

So, these are all of my insights, discoveries, my story and everything I learned which I thought would be great to share with you all

Finally, a few more methods which I have heard can help but I haven't tried yet seem to include Acupuncture and Sauna. Apparently they provide some benefits too, though I haven't tried them yet.

I would like however to learn more from anyone else here about why exercise helps so much and why, apart from my own findings which I have provided here

I hope all of this information helps everyone here, you can all do it, I still need to attain more improvements myself too, but so far I can see that recovery is possible, and it is possible for all of you too ‚ù§",https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1eq2sn8/my_story_cptsd_and_chronic_stress_symptoms/,1723430761.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1ctqqok,Stress,Stress causing hallucination in elderly?,"Hi everyone 

I‚Äôm confused because I have a family member that is experiencing hallucinations and agitation out of no where. 

I raised concerns about that plus other things such as hair loss to the doctor. The doctor keeps reporting memory loss concerns, but memory loss is not an issue in my opinion. The family member‚Äôs memory is good and better than some younger kids‚Ä¶shoot even mine.

It‚Äôs the hallucination that‚Äôs the concern.

The refuse to consider the meds being the causes of that but agreed that the med management is a little messy currently. 

I contacted the pharmacist where we picked the meds up at and they review her prescription history on a quick phone call and think it can be a result of low sugar maybe, but says the meds in question wouldn‚Äôt cause that.

It confuses me because I looked up the meds in question and they have side effects of what I‚Äôm complaining about online.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do. My hope was to get the medical team on the same page so we can stop the meds, monitor, test, and analyze from their. That way we can manage the meds a little better and slowly add things back as needed and safely.

I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is saying there‚Äôs no side effects or not these side effects as the side effects in question pops up on the first page of Google.

What can I do? The medical team didn‚Äôt see anything that stands out on the mri but is calling the issue maybe dementia due to a memory loss test that I believe the family member did good in. I was there. It was just calculations that were not good. 

I‚Äôm going to connect with a neurologist next, but I just don‚Äôt want to be quick to call something dementia when it‚Äôs might be due to medication.

It‚Äôs like they just want to give meds that have similar effects to these other diagnoses or disorders and say that person has X and when it gets worse it‚Äôs not due to X but truly secretly due to the meds.

I‚Äôm just hoping to connect and learn from others here in hopes with making the next best steps to help with what‚Äôs happening.

Meds in question:
Mirtazapine
Atorvastatin
Diabetic medication- one was recently stopped which I thought was the cause of the hallucinations but they started the family memeber on mirtazapine the same week where things got worst.

They assigned more meds in the past but I believe the issue started from one or both of these.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1ctqqok/stress_causing_hallucination_in_elderly/,1715901158.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

**Sea Moss: The What, The Why, and Whether It‚Äôs For You**

Once confined to the ocean floor and your vegan friend‚Äôs pantry,¬†*sea moss*, aka Irish moss, has officially gone mainstream.

In 2024, the global market hit $1.2B and is set to double by 2033.

So what‚Äôs the boom for?

Because sea moss now claims to do¬†*everything*¬†short of filing your taxes.

Allegedly‚Ä¶. the list run deeps: immunity, thyroid support (thanks to its iodine), glowing skin, better gut health, and even libido boosts.

Just hold on one second. Before you slather it on your face or blend it into your smoothie.

Here‚Äôs the truth.

Most of the research is early-stage, animal-based, or done in petri dishes.

**Let‚Äôs take a look at the science, the good and the bad:**

* Rats fed sea moss showed¬†[prebiotic benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4535385/?utm_campaign=is-sea-moss-the-new-collagen&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive); better gut microbiome, and immune markers
* A human study (80 adults) suggested¬†[reduced fatigue](http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e738/03c0c048b63e0f6119ccdfd4bd93c5ad3e37.pdf?utm_campaign=is-sea-moss-the-new-collagen&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive)¬†in musculoskeletal pain
* Sea moss may possess neuroprotective effects,¬†[according to this study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/13/4/2250?utm_campaign=is-sea-moss-the-new-collagen&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive)¬†on roundworms.
* On the flipside, dosage swings carry thyroid risk\*\*.\*\* One gel serving could supply 85‚ÄØ% RDA
* And another risk, carrageenan, the thickening component commonly used within sea moss products,¬†[may harm gut integrity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8539934/?utm_campaign=is-sea-moss-the-new-collagen&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive), worsen colitis or IBD

There‚Äôs a reason to be cautious here.

High iodine carries a thyroid trap, heavy-metal contamination is real, and quality control is a wildcard in the unregulated supplement landscape.

One thing we find positive‚Ä¶¬†**sea moss isn‚Äôt a Gen Z invention.**

The Irish used it during the¬†[Potato Famine in the 1840s](https://www.foodingredientfacts.org/irish-moss-the-history-of-carrageenans-roots/?utm_campaign=is-sea-moss-the-new-collagen&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive)¬†for sustenance, hence ‚ÄúIrish moss.‚Äù

In the Caribbean, it‚Äôs been consumed for centuries as a¬†**libido tonic, immune booster, and cultural staple**.

Most of the good stuff in 2025 comes from warm Caribbean waters, especially off the coasts of Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Grenada.

However, while its traditional uses are rich, modern claims outpace the research.

But hey, it‚Äôs not the first time the wellness world got a little too excited about sea slime.

If you‚Äôre going to start somewhere, we suggest sticking with the major brands.

A few notables:

|Brand|Format|Notable Features|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
|TrueSeaMoss|Gels, capsules, gummies‚Ä¶|Lab-tested, widely available|
|Glasswing Organics|Capsules|Added botanicals, clean-living focus|
|Nature‚Äôs Vision|Powder & capsules|Health-store staple, budget-friendly|
|Everboost / Transf.|Flavored gels|Influencer-backed, beauty/fitness claims|
|Dr. Sebi|Pure sea moss gel|Wildcrafted, zero additives|

Sea moss might earn its sea legs in the longevity world, but for now, it's more hype than hard science.

We‚Äôll let you make the call here on whether it deserves a place in your health stack.

1i5dd5z,Aging,I'm noticing a trend of GenX & Older Millennials Opting to Age Alone. I will not be joining them.,"I've written this for those who can relate. 
This is not a judgment.
I'm waving from the other side of a dark tunnel. 
By the end, you will know if this was meant for *you.*

Let me first start by saying, ""I get it.""
Like, I truly get it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I have been burned in the past. 
I've been the one who has put in the effort without reciprocation. I've been the mom the other moms gossip about when I leave the book club table.

""Isn't she just so... weird?""
""Right?! She never shuts the fck up!""

But I didn't know I was neurodivergent until my early 40s.üôÉ

When the pandemic started in 2020, for the first time, life slowed down enough for me to **think and process** my life. I went into a deep situational depression. And cried for weeks.

I cried recounting *all* the moments when *all* the clues and cues were there, but I just didn't...process them. 

I also did a lot of self-reflection and saw where *I* was clearly the problem. 

And most importantly, I rid myself of the person who had always made me a scapegoat and programmed me to feel unworthy in the first place.

GAME CHANGER. 

Nearly five years later, I've completely turned my life around. I'm older, but lighter in load. I have forgiven myself and have largely healed from old wounds.

I've not only read up on and studied the matters of social dynamics, I've put them into practice. I'm more resilient now than ever and I've thrived in the ""love bubbles"" I've created.

I've confirmed what I've always known about myself. I'm a good friend. I'm someone who values my relationships. I'm a *kinkeeper.*

Now, as I near 50 (shout-out to fellow Xennial '76 Dragons ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®) and the end of parenting a minor, I look forward to the next chapter.

I refuse to take all the wisdom I've gained about myself and the universal nature of humans and throw it away.

Hell no.

Friendship is so important to me that, in just a few years, I will be relocating out of the country and devoting my middle-aged life to the pursuit of building it. *(I agree with the adage that ""people are generally the same wherever you go,"" but I also recognize that economies shape cultural and behavioral norms. So, off I go!)*

I will *not* be opting out of lifelong friendship and community just when I'll need it the most. Just as I'm mastering the skills and the ""cheat codes"" to life.

And lastly‚Äîdo people realize that when they talk about ""not liking people,"" they, too, are also ""the people""?

Me not giving up on people is a vote of confidence in *myself.* I choose to believe that I'm not that unique. The society I live in simply isn't optimized for the friendships and community I want. 

I'm going to stfu now. I hope I've given someone food for thought. I will never shame those who feel they have nothing left. That they've been scarred too deeply. I see you and wish you peace in hermit life.

But if you don't feel *absolutely certain* about forever giving up on finding and building your tribe (via organically, or intentionally)?

This was for you.

1ic7u7t,Aging,Husband has become so critical lately.,"Update:  Again, thank you for all the comments and advice.  I just wanted to let you all know that I am going to go see a counselor on Thursday, tomorrow.  On Feb. 4, I see the attorney and Feb. 12 I see my doctor.  I can't make him go to the doctor, so I will see how the other appointments go before I say anything else to him.  To his credit, he DID help me fix supper this evening because I had a late appointment with the ENT (ear, nose, throat).  It was a very welcome thing that he did.  My daughter and I both bragged about how good it was.


My husband (76) and I (71) have been married 30 years.  The past couple of years he has become so critical of me that it is almost unbearable.  Examples: I can‚Äôt peel a potato correctly (because I had hand reconstruction last October), I took the dogs on their nightly walk but forgot to turn the porch light off.  I heard about it this morning.  I can‚Äôt cook anything good enough.  I don‚Äôt pick up after him fast enough.  The house isn‚Äôt clean enough.  I don‚Äôt take the trash out on time.  The list goes on and on.  I have had it but I don‚Äôt know what to do.  If I had somewhere else to go, I believe I would leave.  I need advice.  How would you handle this or am I overthinking?  I need help and don‚Äôt know where to turn.

Hello Everyone.  I can't believe all of the positive support I am receiving from you all.  I never imagined that so many people cared.  Let me give you all a little perspective so that you might understand where I am coming from.  My husbend, G, was abused by his parents.  His dad was very physical with punishment, emotionally distant and his mother was emotionally abusive.  I have always felt very sorry for him with what he suffered as a child.  I know this all happened from conversations with other members of his family.  It was an open secret.  When he was 18, he went to Vietnam at the height of the Tet Offensive.  He saw a lot, was in a lot, was injured, the whole nine yards.  He left home a teenager and came home an old man.  It had a profound affect on him.  But, he seemed to rise above it.  He went to college and had a good career.  He has 2 adult sons and we see them several times a year. He retired in 2002, comfortable financially.  We married in 1996 (I think).  I was an elementary educator for 41 years and have always put all of my finances into the joint pot.  He owned our house for 2 years before we got married and has refused to put my name on the deed, even though I helped pay for everything. So this is why I don't know where I would go if I were to leave. Plus I am guardian of my daughter and she needs a stable place to live. The house is now paid off.  Our vehicles are paid off and we don't have credit cards.  As I stated earlier, he does not behave like this in front of anyone but me and my daughter but the boys all know that things are not good.  They can sense it.  I have said some things to my son so he knows I'm miserable.  G is not a horrible person.  He is loved by so many and has held positions of high esteem within the community so if I leave, the whole town would be shocked.  Years ago when I left for a week, no one knew except for my best friend, her husband and my parents.  (I went to stay in their vacant house.)  My son was in the military at the time and was not here to help.  I'm sorry this is so convoluted.  But I guess I'm just spilling my guts out now.  I love G.  I want us to be happy.  I have really tried but I just don't know how to handle it any more.  I do have an upcoming appointment with our doctor and my attorney.  The doctor knows him as well, as my husband also sees him. He does nothing around the house. He has no hobbies and only does what he wants to do.  He gets annoyed when I take my daughter to the movie or if I go with a friend.  But he goes out every Tuesday with his old military buddies.  I don't think he has a girlfriend except on his phone (if you get my drift).  Maybe I'm getting too deep into this for all of you.  But maybe saying all this will give you perspective.  I appreciate all of you for caring about me and my daughter.  It has literally moved me to tears.  Thank you all so much and I will update you when I know more.  Thank you!

UPDATE: Feb. 18, 2025
Once again, I thank you all for your comments and concern.  Since I have had requests to update you, I will take a moment to do that.  I went to see my attorney.  He said that it is not ethically right for him to NOT put my name on the deed, There will be nothing I can do about it if he puts it in his will.  I don't know if he has written a new will or not.  I did change my will, though.  Everything I have will go to my son, granddaughter and grandson.  I also changed my medical decisions to be controlled by my son.  He will also be the executor of my will.  Next, I went to talk it out with a counselor.  She asked LOTS of questions and it helped to just think things through with someone not connected with us.  I will be going back to see her.  Last, I went to our family doctor.  He gave me an RX to help with my neck & shoulders.  (That's where I carry my stress.)  As far as husband is concern, somehow he has become a little softer this past week.  Perhaps even HE could see that I was fixing to break.  I don't know, but I'm glad he has let up some.  My daughter is good and is glad for the reprieve.  I'll end by saying once more that I appreciate all of the support you have given me.  Thank you so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1ic7u7t/husband_has_become_so_critical_lately/,1738087466.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

The fact that I won‚Äôt be able to attract young girls‚Äô attention anymore, that my parents won‚Äôt care about me as much as before, the few white hairs appearing on my hair and beard, being a bit too old to go to nightclubs and concerts, etc., make me seriously feel like life is over.

The purge. I've helped a couple of people who inherited a hoarder's house. I am not a hoarder. But I looked around my own house and realized that I have some crap that's taking up space. I've spent about 1 day a week purging. I started with clothes. I had work and not work clothes, all mixed together. Threw a blanket on the living room floor and dumped all of my clothes. Went through all of it, got rid of a third of that stuff. Now my clothes are better organized.


Then I moved on to the kitchen. OMG. I had spices that had expired two years ago. Yuck. Even found a can of expired tomatoes. 

Then the bathroom. Tip. Any old prescriptions can be taken to a pharmacy to be disposed of properly.

Currently I m working on my office. How many old cords and chargers should I  keep?( mostly for devices I no longer have). I have found out about the county electronic recycling center, been there once. Going back with more stuff.

Cleaning out this stuff has been liberating and damn satisfying.

1ht52i6,Aging,I wish people stopped saying that aging is a privilege. Aging is a TRAGEDY!,"I wish people stopped saying that aging is a beautiful thing, and that we should age gracefully, and that the alternative to aging (death) is worse and blah blah blah‚Ä¶ NONE of that BS. Aging is a real curse. There is nothing graceful about aging. And I‚Äôm not even talking about becoming uglier, dried up, wrinkled, flaccid, ineffective, slower. I‚Äôm not even talking about gray hair that, no matter what platitudes you hear, ages your face. I‚Äôm talking about losing your vitality, your vibrancy, your spark, your zest.

Take my grandmother, for example. She loved riding her bicycle while running errands in town. It made her super happy. She was devastated when she could no longer ride her bicycle due age-related aches and pains. She could no longer cross-stitch and knit, her favorite hobbies, when her eyesight worsened. She became a shell of her former self as she grew older. **And we‚Äôre supposed to say that aging is beautiful? Fuck that stupid shit. I hate the hypocrisy surrounding aging.** It makes me angry. Have you ever seen someone‚Äôs cognitive abilities deteriorating due to Alzheimer‚Äôs? If you have, you still want me to believe that aging is beautiful? Women who try to look younger are shamed and ridiculed and told that they should passively accept their decrepit bodies. But decrepitude is not attractive.

My grandmother lived until 95, and she was very aware till her last day, and she told me she felt imprisoned in her aging body which severely handicapped her. She wanted to die. A former neighbor could no longer enjoy classical music because she was becoming deaf (again, age-related). She used to be a musician.

These are just some examples. My friend tells me that she‚Äôs noticing her brain is not as sharp as it used to be when she was younger. I‚Äôm noticing this myself too. I used to have a prodigious memory and be laser-focused. Not anymore. And the risk of cancer goes up as you age. I could literally list thousands of reasons as to why aging sucks, but it‚Äôs stupid that I should state the obvious. I know we don‚Äôt have a cure for aging, but just because there isn‚Äôt a solution, I can‚Äôt lie to myself and vomit those stupid platitudes about aging gracefully.

And for those who say that the alternative to aging, namely death, is much worse, that‚Äôs dumb. I don‚Äôt want to live up to 95 if I can‚Äôt see, I can‚Äôt enjoy my hobbies, and I‚Äôll feel incapacitated by my own decaying body.

UPDATE:

1. People are saying that their son, daughter, father, or mother died of cancer/accident or endured an otherwise tragic and premature death. I am very sorry about that, but this is whataboutism. Just because your daughter died of cancer when she was young, that does NOT negate the brutalities that come with aging. Nobody should experience cancer, young or old. However, just because people die horribly when young, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend aging is beautiful. Cancer is horrible, but aging is also horrible. Both things can co-exist.
2. Saying that there's nothing we can do about aging so we shouldn't complain is truly demented. It's like telling a mourning mother not to cry because crying won't bring her dead son back. Truly, truly stupid. I've already addressed it in my original post, but most people just read the title. I'm entitled to write posts about how horrible aging is even if there isn't any cure yet. To find a cure against aging we should first acknowledge, without hypocrisy, that aging is a disease. The fact that there are horrible diseases like cancer doesn't make aging more attractive. WTF! Reminds me of people who dismiss your problems saying there are dying children in Africa.
3. Saying that aging is part of life is also demented. It doesn't make me feel any better. Shit is also part of life, but it doesn't make me like shit or bury my face in shit. Stop saying that it's beautiful because it's part of life. It's a thought-terminating cliche.

Let me tell you that **there is absolutely nothing graceful about aging. NOTHING**. People should stop using platitudes like ""age gracefully."" I'm not saying this to be a bitch, but the hypocrisy surrounding aging truly irks me. Even if science hasn't found a way to reverse aging, we should not pretend that it's a desirable thing.

I always encounter people saying that aging is a privilege and that it beats the alternative. Bullshit. I want these people to spend 24 hours in my unit. **Most of the patients I deal with would rather be dead. They're rotting away**. Some of them are not even conscious because Alzheimer's is a horrific disease. So tell me what is graceful about that.

I would say that 90% of our patients have children (it's a rough estimate), but their children abandoned them, sometimes through no fault of their own, because dealing with an elderly patient who defecates and urinates on himself/herself, cleaning them up, removing the socks and seeing all the flakes flying, dealing with the phlegm and all of that is not easy. When I hear about children abandoning their parents in a nursing home, I want to say that, first of all, these children did not choose to be born. Second of all, **even the most sympathetic person is not properly equipped to deal with a decomposing parent**. There is no unconditional love. Aging parents are a burden on their children.

After seeing what I've seen, I would rather die in my 60s than live through decay.

People who attempt to look younger are shamed, demonized, and made fun of. This is why tons of celebrities like Martha Stewart have facelifts and pretend they are against plastic surgery. No wonder.

On a related note, I truly admire Jacqueline Jencquel, a French woman who, like all French people, was brutally honest and cynical (in a good way) in her interview. I recommend you look her up. She expressed things way better than I could.

Lastly, most people believe that drinking water, dieting and exercising will translate into optimal quality of life in old age. Bullshit. Aging means that all the cells in your body are failing. No amount of diet or exercise can prevent aging. A lot of the patients we see rotting away were active back in the day. A healthy lifestyle is necessary but not sufficient.

We only found this out when we took her to a specialist, fearful that she might be developing alzheimer's or dementia. 

I live abroad but try to call her several times per week. However, it's excruciatingly hard to speak to her, as she can repeat herself up to 5 times in 10 minutes. Not only that, I feel like she has no real interests that we can talk about - she won't amuse me with stories of her youth, doesn't seem able to describe the TV shows she was watching just before picking up the phone, etc.  As a result, we always end up talking about the weather, about what she sees looking outside the window, and about when she's planning to go to bed. She often asks me what's going on in my life, but when I tell her: 1) she sometimes can't keep up, 2) she most definitely will not remember and ask again soon, 3) she only seems vaguely interested (potentially because she can't keep up?)

I am not talking about the physical stuff (that's already happening).  I am talking about mental decline.  Even before full-blown dementia sets in, it seems most all of our older relatives (70+) have shown signs of mental decline.  For example, a couple of them fell for scams that they never would have fallen for when they were younger and the financial damage was bad.  A couple have become incessant talkers and no one wants to to be around them, including the other incessant talkers.  I notice some start wearing too much perfume and since I'm allergic ,when I'm at church I try not to sit near older ladies. Others don't want to give up the car keys or move into a different living situation when they can no longer maintain a house.  These types of things are what I fear most about aging. While my husband is here hopefully he can alert me to behaviors and vice versa but what if he has the same issues or if I become a widow?  I wonder if I should write a list of reminders and tape it to the bathroom mirror of things to avoid such as,  ""don't give out personal info on the phone"" and ""don't talk too much today""  and ""do you need to start hiring a cleaning lady?""

1jc4lv6,Aging,How a Plant-Based Diet and Living Conditions Affect Brain Health in Older Adults,"# Why Diet and Living Conditions Matter for Brain Health

As people age, keeping their brains healthy is a big concern. Some things that affect brain function, like eating habits and living conditions, can make a huge difference. A recent study in China looked at how diet and living conditions impact the risk of memory loss and thinking problems in older adults.

# How Diet and Living Conditions Work Together

The study found that **both diet and living conditions influence brain health**, but in different ways:

* Poor living conditions, such as financial stress, unstable housing, and isolation, can increase the risk of memory problems.
* A plant-based diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, provides essential nutrients that support brain function and may counteract some of the negative effects of poor living conditions.
* Those who lived in poor conditions and **also had an unhealthy diet** were at the highest risk for cognitive decline.
* However, even in difficult living conditions, people who ate **a healthy, plant-based diet had better brain function over time** compared to those with poor diets.

# Understanding Living Conditions

In this study, living conditions were divided into three categories:

* **Good conditions**: Stable housing, financial security, and adequate personal space.
* **Fair conditions**: Some instability in housing or finances, limited personal space, or moderate environmental stress.
* **Poor conditions**: Unstable or unsafe housing, financial hardship, overcrowding, or high levels of stress and isolation.

# What the Study Found

Researchers followed 1,630 adults aged 65 and older for ten years. They checked their memory and thinking skills using a standard test and looked at their diet and living conditions.

Here‚Äôs what they discovered:

* People living in **fair conditions** had an **86% higher chance** of developing memory problems than those in good conditions.
* Those in **poor living conditions** had a **206% higher risk** of memory decline.
* The risk was worse for people who ate **fewer plant-based foods** compared to those who ate more.

This means that **eating a plant-based diet may help protect the brain, even for those living in difficult conditions**.

# Actionable Takeaways: How to Protect Brain Health

1. **Eat More Plant-Based Foods**
   * Include more **fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains** in your meals.
   * Avoid processed foods and sugary snacks that can harm brain health.
   * Get enough plant-based proteins like lentils and tofu to support brain function.
2. **Improve Living Conditions If Possible**
   * **Ensure stable housing**: Safe and comfortable living spaces help reduce stress.
   * **Financial security**: Access to healthcare and nutritious food is essential for brain health.
   * **Personal space and social interaction**: Being socially active and having personal space for relaxation can improve mental well-being.
3. **Combine Diet with Other Healthy Habits**
   * **Stay active**: Simple exercises like walking or stretching can improve brain function.
   * **Stay connected**: Talking to friends and family helps keep the brain engaged.
   * **Keep learning**: Reading, puzzles, and other brain activities help prevent memory loss.

# Final Thoughts

This study shows that **diet and living conditions together play a big role** in keeping the brain sharp as we age. While poor living conditions can increase the risk of memory loss, **eating a plant-based diet is a simple and effective way to protect brain health**. Even small changes in eating habits and daily routines can have a big impact on mental well-being over time.

cw3h1l,Aging,Elderly Living: 7 Dangers of Seniors Living Alone at Home,"The sad truth is that a lot of us become less able to be independent as we age. It's a hard fact to face, but it's something you may need to consider thoughtfully if you have an elderly loved one who is still living on their own. The elderly living alone can put them at risk for some serious physical and emotional dangers.

By the year 2030, adults over 65 will comprise [20% of the U.S. population](https://www.ioaging.org/aging-in-america)!¬†One in 5 people living in America will be over 65 and could be at risk for any of these issues. We should do our best to be aware of what they are and to prevent them.

We've compiled a list of some of the biggest danger risks you should be aware of. Read on to learn what they are!

1. Loneliness and Depression

A common situation many seniors face is social isolation as they age. Maybe a¬†spouse or friend passes on before them or their physical limitations prevent them from being able to go out as much as they once did. This lack of freedom can result in a lot more time alone at home without human interaction.

This isolation can make seniors feel lonely, with no one to spend time with or talk to. Friendship is something that we as humans have a basic need for, and depriving ourselves of friendship can be [just as damaging](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200307/the-dangers-loneliness) to us as going without food. This can lead to physical ailments like high blood pressure and memory loss.

1hrge2r,Dementia,Bowel incontenience and dementia ,"Hi! A gorgeous grandparent (91f) has dementia and is struggling with bowel incontenience to the extreme.

She also will not go to the doctor about it, she doesn't want treatment for things anymore (I was taking her to the doctor when I was a child about her bowel, and she reached a point long before her dementia diagnosis that she didn't want the invasive checks and treatments required - we respect this). 

I was wondering if anybody had ideas of things we could carry or keep in the house to help? Obviously proper disposable underwear for big accidents, I thought maybe some spare trousers and so on. We cleaned her up, gave her a cuddle, distracted her afterwards to calm her down, blankets.

8abx5k,Dementia,Reddit Diets Survey: What diet works for your health concerns? Help others find what might work for them. All data to be open-sourced on Reddit.,"TL;DR: Take a short survey to help other Redditors find a diet that might better address their health concerns. Answer as many or as few questions as you want. The better the data the more impact it will have.

Survey Link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/redditdiets
 
The Data: All of the data will be made openly available in an unedited format in select intervals during survey collection and upon survey completion. It will be posted to both this thread and in a new unveiling post. I'm hoping for some serious throw downs amongst the various analytical subreddits on what can be gleaned from the results.

Motivation: As someone who's watched friends cycle through dozens of diets in attempts to address everything from diabetes to allergies I've been astounded by the variety of what different people say works for them. There are so many dietary fads these days and a lot of pseudoscience, but one thing that is undeniable is the sheer variety of diets that work for cultures around the world. The goal of this survey is to see if quantitative trends can be found supporting, if only anecdotally, the use of specific diets for addressing specific or general health concerns. In an attempt to make the survey brief yet impactful questions are limited to broader categories.    

Questions: All questions are optional and include Diet, Health Outcome, Age, and Gender. Age and Gender are included because it is possible that for hormonal reasons some diets work better for certain ages and genders. Diet options in the survey include vegetarian, paleo, low-carb/keto, vegan, SCD, gluten-free, dairy-free, and an 'other' option which can be filled in with anything not listed. Health outcomes addressed by your diet can include allergies, weight/fitness, diabetes, autism, gastrointestinal health(general), mental health/clarity, autoimmune disease(general), arthritis, UTI, Crohn's disease, IBS, IBD, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, thyroid disease, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, kidney stones, gallstones, gout, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, skin health(including eczema), asthma, sinus issues, and lupus among others.

r6wz9p,Dementia,My mom died today,"My mom has been suffering from vascular dementia secondary to Crohn‚Äôs disease since about February of this year. Her decline was very rapid, which I recognize as a blessing in the grand scheme of things. 

We had her on home hospice after two months of hospitalization, but due to her ostomy bag and bedridden status, she needed round the clock care in order to be comfortable. So, we did what she told me never to do and had her go to a nursing home (still in hospice care). 

Her time at home, though chaotic and uncomfortable for a variety of reasons, was a gift because her six grandsons were all able to come see her one last time. Obviously they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to in hospital or a facility due to Covid restrictions.

She spent two weeks in skilled nursing, and her depression lifted and it was obvious she was much more comfortable. I really thought she may live several more months at least, maybe enough time to get her into a wheelchair and out of her room. But it was not to be.

This morning I walked in around 10:15 and immediately noticed she had had a stroke. The right side of her face was drooping slightly and she was leaning to that side. But her arms and legs could move evenly and she was lucid.

We had a good hour visit. We laughed, watched some cute animals on tv, talked about family, looked at pictures. I fed her a yogurt drink, a baby food pouch, and gave her water. Noticed she was having trouble with the straw. My dad was there, too. 

But I noticed her fingers and around her mouth were purplish and she was cold to the touch, so I asked the nurse to get vitals. I wanted to be prepared for end of life signs, but I also suspected her oxygen sats were low and she would need comfort care with oxygen.

Her O2 was great, but her body temp was 85! So I thought, okay this is a sign her body is shutting down and I should be prepared for her passing in the next few days. 

Well, after her vitals, my dad got really anxious and made way to leave. He said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have to pick up (your youngest) from preschool?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah in an hour. I‚Äôm going to stay with her a little longer.‚Äù He packed up and gave her one last kiss goodbye, which she reciprocated. That was the last lucid thing she did.

I kid you not, the second the door closed after him, she turned to me and her breathing was labored. She had a glossy look come over her. I prayed over her, told her I loved her and she was a good mom, and said to go with the angels. I know people tend to stay in this state of agonal breathing for hours and even days before death, but for her it was only five minutes. She died at 11:26 am.

She was waiting for us to come, to say goodbye to my dad, and for him to leave. I‚Äôm honored she felt comfortable enough with me to succumb in my presence. Her facility has had a Covid outbreak, and pending one more confirmed case, they were going to shut down visitors.

I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to be by her side and usher her through with dignity. I know our journey was incredibly short compared to most, but I wanted to share that in the end, it was intense and beautiful. 

Thank you for all your support these past confusing months, and know I pray for you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/r6wz9p/my_mom_died_today/,1638413941.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Psychiatrist  is great on meds for BP and obsessive worry but terrible for sounding board and advice re suicidal  thoughts and everything  else. Seen therapist twice. Think it may help. Dunno.

 Me:  lvl 41, chronically ill, just had a spinal fusion and need alot of help myself. I care for both my senior parents in my home. Mom is 70 and in her 3rd remission from cancer and is starting symptoms of Alzheimers and also has manic/bill polar episodes that make her very aggressive and angry. She is alot and with my dad not doing well she's acting like a kid needing attention and it's been a wear and tear on everyone. I understand she's having a hard time with dad fading daily.

My dad is my biggest concern. He's 80, just had a kidney taken out for cancer and the one that's left is at 20% and they told us he's at Stage 4 Kindney Disease and with his dementia he's not gonna do well with dyslysis. Each day he's less and less of himself and watching him disappear like this is just hard.

He's a vet and I've reached out to the VA for help the last 3 years I've had him and they are horrible, I need up getting him set up with my doctors in town and he's comfortable. At thus point we are setting up for palliative care at home. I want to keep him.


They both live with me and I take care of them while taking care of myself. Due to my disability I can't drive and do alot so my husband helps me care for them and myself.


My questions/concerns are if I'm doing enough, am I doing things right? I've got him medically set up but I feel this dread constantly that he's not ok, my moms complaining doesn't help and each day my dad is here less and less and I honestly don't know if I'm doing anything right.
I have flared my ulcerative colitis and I'm posting on here because I really feel like I'm not doing anything good for my family. Sorry this is how my mind is right now.
I literally just called my little sister( who is stationed in Georgia and Im in California)and all his siblings to tell them that dad isn't doing so well and the doctor said to get things in order. 

I feel like I'm in a fog and everyone depends on me and I feel like I'm failing my family.

Sorry for the rambling, I'm new to posting here and just am overwhelmed

So here‚Äôs the deal, I‚Äôm pregnant for the first time with twins and it hasn‚Äôt been easy. I‚Äôve been dealing with HG (severe morning sickness) since my first trimester and I also have ulcerative colitis which has been flaring up for the past couple weeks. It‚Äôs miserable. On top of that my husband and I are closing on a house first week of February and moving further away. We are also still in the process of showing our condo and I still work the other week days. I am so overwhelmed and feel horrible most of the time. I‚Äôm stressed about the pregnancy because I haven‚Äôt been gaining the amount of weight I‚Äôm supposed to and am constantly getting sick.

I told my father that once we close on the house and move it will be very hard for me to help with my mom. This is the truth, but I also need a break physically and emotionally because I feel more exhausted than I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty, like I‚Äôm forcing this on my dad and abandoning my mom. I can‚Äôt help feeling like this is selfish of me, but even if I still made the long drive over there well into my 3rd trimester I‚Äôll still have to stop once the twins come. 

I‚Äôve asked him a couple times if he has plans for Wednesday‚Äôs and every time he acts annoyed. He doesn‚Äôt have any plans yet but we‚Äôre just a couple weeks away from moving. I miss my mother. I won‚Äôt have her to help with my shower, I won‚Äôt have her there to help once the babies come. I would never ask my dad for that stuff, all I want is for him to make sure she‚Äôs taken care of. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll end up home alone on Wednesday‚Äôs. I know he‚Äôs going through a lot and I hate putting this on him. I hate nagging him but I wish I could get through to him.

av8hqa,Dementia,MIL with Lewy Body Dementia has moved in. Advice please?,"I would appreciate any  advice or insights you all might have on our situation. I apologize for the length. 

My husband‚Äôs mother just moved in with us, moving from CA to OK. She has Lewy Body Dementia, Ulcerative Colitis, arthritis, and blood clots. She‚Äôs in her mid 50s. Based on the Ken Keane videos, I'd say she's approximately in Stage 5, with a few hints of 6. I do most of the day-to-day care, while my husband will be working outside the home. She has been on SSI and MediCal. We are in the process of getting my husband listed as her Representative Payee for her SSI.  She has lived with us before, I was the one who originally saw symptoms of dementia, but she wasn't diagnosed until she moved out of our home last time, in 2015.

Biggest issue (to me at least) first: She's in denial about her dementia, she talks about not being able to see because a doctor screwed up her eyes (not true). How do I address this with other people while she's around? I definitely don't want to make her feel stupid (which she does often when she can't find or do something) or argue with her, but at the same time, I need to be able to communicate with people (doctors, people at church) that she's not well. I don't see any help in trying to convince her that she's ill. What do I say in situations where she says something not true or inappropriate? 

Financial Questions: 

* Where do I go to get health insurance for her?(I assume healthcare.gov, but I don't know where to get Medicaid) 
* Will her living in our home change the subsidy for my family‚Äôs health insurance, since we buy it through the exchange? 
* Should we include her as a dependent on our 2019 taxes?
* I understand her SSI is meant to cover her living expenses, can I use that to pay a utility bill or do I have her write a check directly to myself and my husband to cover her ‚Äúrent‚Äù? We aren‚Äôt trying to take advantage of that money, obviously, but we will have higher utilities from an extra person in the house. 
* Should we apply for food stamps/EBT for her? Or should she be using the SSI for groceries?

Social Questions:

* What do we do when we can no longer provide enough care for her in our home? We have decided our boundary is incontinence or violence to ourselves and/or our children.
* How do you know if she's able to be left alone in the home and for how long? She can't prepare food for herself, or get her own medicine, so I assume if ever, for a max of a few hours.
* Do I need to be stimulating and entertaining to her? She sat on the couch doing nothing (TV not on) for nearly two hours tonight after dinner, is this normal?
* She's talked about meeting up with an old friend here in our town. Should I try to contact this person? I don't think MIL has any contact info for her, but I could find her on FB. Would this be inappropriate? Should I warn her of the LBD?
* Does it do me any good to put her things back where they belong after she's ""rearranged?"" She's moved some of her socks to her bedside table, moved her razor stash to her bedroom from the bathroom, etc. 
* Does anyone have any advice for having her in the same home with my toddler? It seems all the baby proofing is too much of a hindrance for MIL (cabinet and toilet locks, baby gates).

Also, if you have any other advice (or could point me towards the appropriate sub) for having a disabled elder living with you, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it! Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/av8hqa/mil_with_lewy_body_dementia_has_moved_in_advice/,1551237628.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
1ldxk00,Dementia,Did you feel relief/ less anxiety once your loved one went to an assisted living/ MC?,"This is a decision I‚Äôve been grappling with recently as my mother now lives alone after the death of my dad. I am 31 with a full time job and pets. She has caregivers that come, but she is going downhill quickly. She is about stage six Alzheimer‚Äôs. She also lives about two hours from me so it‚Äôs very hard to go check on her. I‚Äôve been thinking about looking into assisted living facilities in my area because her area is way more rural, and mine has a ton of health facilities, given that I live near a big city. But I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty about even considering it. She‚Äôs only 66 which makes it really hard ecause she would be one of the younger residents. 
She owns a large house on 2 acres and it‚Äôs so much to maintain without my dad. We‚Äôve had to hire professionals for just about everything. And I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs wandering a little more around the  property and house so it makes me nervous.

My question is, did you feel any relief Once your loved one went into a facility? The anxiety I‚Äôm dealing with every day is overwhelming and I‚Äôm constantly worrying something is gonna go wrong with her in her home. Luckily, with the sale of her house, she would be able to live in a nice facility for a long time.

1m7nnm0,Dementia,"How is best to deal with their anxiety, overthinking and crazy scenarios they make up?","For at least the last three years, my grandma has no longer been able to do anything fun to stimulate her mind. We tried to find a re-love for her old interests, new interests but unfortunately just had no joy in anything anymore and we tried everything. For fun, she now just sits all day staring into space with the odd stare out of the window.

Whilst she‚Äôs sat there, she‚Äôs overthinking crazy scenarios in her head and making herself upset and anxious. 

Started off just short of three years ago. My partner was pregnant and really ill and bedridden for a few days. One day when she was feeling better and fed up of being cooped up inside, she decided to go shopping with her young nieces. My grandma was still relatively sound minded then, but out of nowhere just accused my partner of lying to me and seeing other men. Despite the fact she had called round at home with her nieces. 

Since then it‚Äôs been fairly mild. Few false accusations about me and my partner over the years but nothing too major.

Then it started up really badly again a few months ago when a friend who visits regularly was unable to turn up one day. She was sat stewing for ages until she came to me in a panic that something had happened. I tried to gently reassure her that her friend might have been busy, or seeing family or maybe had a doctors appointment. But she was in so much of a state, she couldn‚Äôt accept any reassurance and in her head something terrible had happened. We eventually rang her friend later that evening and she calmed down.

But then a few weeks ago she was trying to tell me a lady who she normally talks to at her daycare, wasn‚Äôt there. There was no potential ‚Äúshe was ill,‚Äù ‚Äúshe could have had an appointment.‚Äù It was immediately ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs died.‚Äù 

But this evening she‚Äôs nearly tipped me over the edge. My partner had gone to the gym and our now two year old is with my MIL for a few days. My grandma was going to bed but stopped to ask me if everything was alright between me and my partner. Now I don‚Äôt mind questions like that, but what gets to me, and I know it‚Äôs the dementia and not my grandma, but it‚Äôs the fact that my answer of ‚Äúyeah everything‚Äôs fine,‚Äù is just not good enough as it was followed by a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you‚Äù look on her face. Admittedly me and my partner have been a bit quiet this week but only because we‚Äôre really busy with things at home and running our business, not because we‚Äôve fallen out.

I really couldn‚Äôt get through that we‚Äôre fine. But then it was all followed by her stressing over our son. She is extremely clingy towards him anyway and we have to limit her time around him, but just started saying it was wrong that he wasn‚Äôt at home, and ‚Äúsomethings happened,‚Äù and when I explained he was spending time with his grandma and had been wanting to see his cousins too who have just finished school for the summer, she was just saying it was wrong and he shouldn‚Äôt be there and he‚Äôll hate it and won‚Äôt be happy. She was trying to accuse us of being neglectful parents I think when if anything we‚Äôre trying to catch a break and have some ‚Äúus‚Äù time that we never get and still don‚Äôt get whilst caring. 

Just another vent post. But I am so exhausted with her sat there overthinking and coming to silly conclusions about things.

Are you at all concerned you might be afflicted. Dementia is known to be weakly genetic, which might be of comfort. I was also lucky enough to have had some genetic and ancestry tests done a while back, which came back negative for genetic susceptibility, which hopefully means I'm at low risk of early onset. I have known people however to avoid such tests for fear they reveal the worst. Even so, with my dad and uncle afflicted, I know I'm not out of the woods. Even with certain symptoms, in my case particularly musculoskeletal, of other conditions, I'm still worried. What do you think?

Just to add that people talking about memory slips, but because my dad has Parkinsons, I'm hypersensitive to movement symptoms, like how much I'm slowing down, how stiff I am in the mornings and signs of any small shakes.

1jxfisq,Dementia,How to deal with extreme anxiety attacks that I can't stop despite assurances,"My father, 83, is on 45 mg of mertzapine and twice a day of 25 mg trazodone as needed. To add insult to injury, he has very bad neuropathy in his legs, his hip is really hurting, elbow really hurts, feet really hurt. It's just a disaster all around. 

We called around and the earliest neurologist appointment is in June. I also called the number the primary care doctor recommended for geriatric psychiatry and they're not accepting any new patients.

The common theme of the afternoon anxiety attacks is that he is broke and will be thrown out into the street. He doesn't believe me when I tell him he has plenty of money in the bank, he gets to live in my house for free, he has nothing to worry about, etc. He thinks his social security payments are a lie and the money in the bank is a lie because he doesn't have it all in stacks of cash in front of him. He just keeps asking about it despite my re-direction.

He can get worked up about other things like weeds in the yard or painting shingles, etc. I had to go to Home Depot at 7PM at night because he was panicking he didnt have nails.

He is just there on the couch crying and shaking about all of this. He thinks everyone is lying to him and he will be abandoned. He says, ""How do I know what you're saying is true?!?"" He just seems frightened about just living now. We have vocalized this with the primary care doctor and neurologist and all we were offered is that we have to just wait.

How can we live like this? I go to work and my poor mother is so frazzled with his constant needs that she can barely eat or do anything else.

If I took him to the ER what would they do? Keep him overnight? Days? Commit him?

1k6xb3i,Dementia,"Advice on drugs, anxiety and mania?","I'm hoping people can share their experiences with finding the right meds, and if I should have faith that it'll get worse before it gets better.

Backstory: Earlier this month we had to hospitalize my mom because she hadn't been eating or drinking for weeks. The day we took her to the ER, she was having panic attacks and delusions (I thought just because she was weak from not eating).

They got her stabilized, ruled out physiological causes, and advised us to get her a dementia screening after she was discharged. They also prescribed her 15mg mirtazapine to increase her hunger, and address her anxiety and panic attacks.

It's been two weeks and her mental state hasn't changed. It actually feels like it's gotten worse

We took her to a neurologist earlier this week for stage one of diagnosing and he, for the moment, just prescribed donepezil and didn't suggest changes to the mirtazapine. But I was able to reach my mom's PCP a few days ago who said it's okay to increase it to 30mg and, if nothing's changed after a week, consider taking seroquel.

But every day this week my mom's had intense delusions and panic attacks ‚Äì¬†right now she's packing the house under the belief that the sewer system gave out and they have to move out tonight.

I've read mirtazapine takes 3-6 weeks to kick in, but it doesn't feel like there's been any positive progress at all since she started taking it 2 weeks ago. I've also reached out to the neurologist and PCP for advise, but while I'm waiting to hear back from them I hoped anyone else could share their experiences.

1l0lkrf,Dementia,Anxiety & Neurosis with clothing,"Hi Everyone, my mother-in-law was diagnosed October 2024 and has declined very quickly in 7 months, she is now in assisted living but will be transferred to long term care once space is available. Generally, she experienced a lot of anxiety most of her adult life, and unfortunately some anxieties have become fixations. One that we are really struggling with is anxiety around what to wear. Many of us have experienced frustration finding something to wear for the day, is it appropriate for whats happening that day, will I feel confident, will I feel frumpy, too much or too little to choose from. We've started making outfits for the week on hangers, and limited her closet to what's needed for a week's worth of clothing. It's too overwhelming to go through dressser drawers and comprehend what is there and match an outfit. Because she is in assisted living and not nursing care, residents don't have someone dressing them in the morning. In addition to anxiety, the fixation is checking the closet multiple times because she doesn't trust that there are ready options available, and is scared that she won't be prepared if she needs an outfit later. Throughout the day she is also fixated and anxious about what she has to do to get ready for bed and what she will wear for bed, although it's much easier to choose a pair of pj's. Sometimes while fixating she'll say ""ugh, this is crazy I dont know why I have to do this"" and ""ugh what am I going to do with all these clothes?!"", she is very aware of the compulsive anxious behavior and how distressed she is.

I've been dealing with nocturnal panic attacks and wanted to share my experience to see if anyone else is going through the same or has any advice. For the past six years, I've had my fair share of trauma, which has resulted in a constant fear of flying, claustrophobia, and panic attacks that come and go. I had learned to manage these fairly well and was doing okay until the middle of last year.

One night, for some stupid reason, I decided to take a 5 mg dose of melatonin, thinking it would help me get a good night‚Äôs sleep as I was feeling a bit stressed. For context, I had previously taken 2 mg doses of melatonin without any side effects. But that night, I woke up with a panic attack for the first time in my sleep.

Over the next few months, the panic attacks started happening once or twice a week. Then, this year, they began to occur almost every night. I've tried melatonin, SSRIs, and diazepam, but the only thing that seems to help is Zopiclone 7.5 mg. Unfortunately, when I don't take it, my sleep is terrible, and I feel miserable throughout the day.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced something similar or has any tips on how to manage these nocturnal panic attacks. I'm open to any advice or suggestions that could help me get through this.

I'm 75, healthy and active, and I'm a full-time care giver for my husband with severe dementia who needs almost constant supervision. He doesn't know who I am much of the time, and thinks I'm a visitor or co-worker who knows too much about him.

Things like traveling, seeing friends, having any new experiences are just not possible. I have family that can can stay with him for a few hours a couple of times a month, so I use that time for errands and appointments.

He refuses to see medical providers and is paranoid and controlling. He gets suspicious of people working on our house, and told a technician to leave right in the middle of upgrading our internet service. They wouldn't come back unless I got him out of the house while they finished the job. 

He doesn't perceive that he has any problems, and refuses support services of any kind, so I haven't been able to get any respite care. His medical providers just say to call 911 if the situation becomes unsafe. Unfortunately, his PCP starts each appointment by asking, ""So, how is your memory problem?"" He immediately shuts down, or walks out.

He was not easy to live with before the dementia, and didn't work consistently so our financial situation is poor. I've asked for help from case managers to at least get started with a Medicaid application. We're over income for regular Medicaid but he could qualify if he meets criteria for long term care. I'm told he doesn't qualify yet because he can still dress himself, do basic hygiene and make a sandwich.

Then I read some studies about caregivers dying before the person with dementia, especially if you're over 70! He's still sleeping through most of the night, so I just look forward to each day ending.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1let70d/caregiver_stress/,1750282173.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

She will forget what day and time it is, events she is meant to be at, repetitively ask the same questions over and over again, forget things written in her diary, overstock food and let it go out of date, has been in 3 car incidents within the span of a month, and is overall now very forgetful and timid now.

However, when she went for a week-long break from caring for my grandfather and came back a lot like her old self. It was almost astonishing how improved she was ‚Äî only for that progress to be diminished back to nothing in a couple of days.

She is gone into a major OCD mode but I am her trigger.  She probably feels like she wants to prepare the home but her planning and organising is so poor.  She is just chucking things that I own.  From every room.  She even cleared the whole entire mantle piece in the sitting room and removed some candle holders and candles. It is so depressing because it hurting me so much.  Because it feels like she is trying to erase me from home. 

This is in conjunction with other behaviours like silent treatment and hostility.  

I work in disability care so I am not being sarcastic or rude or her or I am not critical to her. 


There's more and more and more every day.   Yesterday I found that she chucked my supply of alcohol bottles. I am not an alcoholic by the way but I had some bottles and I used to enjoy a drink here or there and never got drunk.  All my bottles poured away and dumped in the bin. 

My brother won't be home for another two weeks so this will be it.  Two weeks of intense anxiety from her about their visit that is showing this way. 

To make it worse the spare room is in chaos. I can't even help or even offer to help or guide her because it will result in anger from her.  Not only that I did offer a few weeks ago and her suggestion was to install a railing system in the room.  I had to make excuses and walk away from that and keep making excuses. There is no space for a railing system.  She has no understanding of that.  Her spacial awareness is poor.  


It's so hard it will be two weeks of this anger and hostility and I can't cope.  


I feel like locking the spare bedroom and hiding the key and let her look for the key for a week and a half as a way to redirect her from being OCD around the home and chucking my belongings away.  
But I don't know if that is the answer. 

She does tend to lock the spare room and sometimes she does take the key.  So that could be an option where I lock it and take it and pretend she did it and just spend the next 10 days looking for a spare key. I don't know.

About 6 to 7 years ago I brought her to a neurologist because I was concerned about her and early onset dementia since her personality was changing and I couldn't attribute it to anything but after a couple of exams they ruled it wasn't dementia and sent her to a psychiatrist in house who did test as well and determined an underlying mental illness which I already knew.

Her memory seems intact for the most part but she has episodes of confusion, doesn't want to drive anymore since her navigation is poor, burst of anger, she's sleeping all through the night and waking up early but she used to be the complete opposite! Just a completely different person in a matter of days. 

Recently, she's been recommended to take diabetic medication since she progressed from pre-diabetes to diabetes and she doesn't want to take it because she's insisting on lifestyle change but the thing is she isn't changing her lifestyle. 

I don't want to take her to a neurologist because what if it's the diabetes doing all this but then she doesn't want to be medicated for diabetes insisting on lifestyle change. I do know her doctor sent in a specialist to do memory test and I assumed she passed since I haven't heard anything otherwise. She has ALWAYS refused any type of mental health saying ""she's not crazy!"" and the only reason why she saw a psychiatrist last time was to proof she was not crazy. 

I'm at a loss!! Really worried and just been crying.

1kzknuh,Dementia,"How to engage my grandpa? Sleeps all day, discouraged, stubborn, depressed.","My 93 year old grandpa's health has been declining since last fall. We suspect dementia and he's waiting to get an appointment with a geriatric specialist. In the meantime, his doctor has been treating him for anxiety/depression since the symptoms started (mirtazapine). 

It is getting increasingly difficult to engage him. I just want him to be able to do things he enjoys, but he is very fatigued all the time and sleeps in front of the TV a lot of days. It is getting harder for him to walk or leave the house because he's slowed down a lot and shuffles his feet now so is prone to falls. We got him a walker but he's still getting used to it and refuses to practice. We try to keep him active in other ways e.g. floor peddler in the TV room, but a lot of the times he just doesn't want to do it anymore, and will get agitated if we push too much. 

I know what this disease can do, but it seems very quick for such a sharp decline :( He's very discouraged because he can't do the things he used to do, which doesn't help. As recently as last summer, he was walking every day just fine.

Over the past few months, I've tried to engage him in a few ways with activities he enjoys-

\- Art: paint by number & colouring - worked well at first but now he gets down on himself and says he can't do it well/gives up. Or gets distracted.

\- Music: this one was good because I would play his favourite music on the TV and he would sing along, even when falling in and out of sleep. Lately though, he seems more disinterested, and bored of his favourite music. 

\- Puzzles and sudoku: like art, he gets discouraged and/or distracted 

That's a few examples off the top of my head. They're still better than him watching the news all day because then it's much easier for him to fall asleep, but he is now less open to getting up and doing these activities in the first place. And I don't want to push him or make him feel like a child.

I don't know what to do. I want to help him feel better and feel more encouraged and happy. I want him to feel capable. I know he is feeling worse and worse, but there must be something that can bring him some more positivity and confidence through this negative time. 

If anyone has any ideas, or things that have worked for their loved ones, I would love to hear them. Thank you.

1h6s4ic,Dementia,How does anyone afford to have Alzheimers???,"So my Mom, 72, has early-mid stage Alzheimers.  To make a long story short, after a brief time living with me, I moved her into AL (with the possibility of it being temporary).

She is a difficult person on a good day and hasn't adjusted well after 8+ months. She wants to live independently and fixates on this.  Also, they just hiked the annual costs due to inflation by $800/mo!! That didn't even include any additional needs.  They nickle and dime everything too.  This place costs nearly 4x my mortgage and she lives in a small room.

My mother needs some help so AL is providing reassurance. Living alone is iffy but if I hired alot of staff it could work. Mainly she needs medication management and someone to help her cook and shop. She doesn't drive so AL having meals provided is a huge convenience.  The cost for this though is insane. Her money will easily be gone in 6ish years and with no other health issues, I assume she might live longer than that.  How is this normal!?

So I ran some numbers on if I helped her buy a house and got in home care. I scaled it based on what I estimate her needs will be over time. 

All I can say is it is lose-lose ... so freaking expensive no matter what you do! It's close to a wash on costs and could be worse if she ends up in memory care anyway in the next few years (the housing market kind of sucks right now).

How are people doing this? It makes me sick to think that my mother's life savings will be pissed away and then she'll be forced into a state facility or I will shoulder a major burden.  Am I missing something? 

Lastly, I cannot care for her. I have a new baby due (any day now), a child with special needs who requires homeschool, and a highly demanding job. I have no siblings or family. Its just me and I'm not in the stage of life where I have any capacity to give beyond checking in on her and coordinating her appointments/general well being.

Edit/Update:  Thank you all for your ideas and advice. I took the advice of meeting with an Elder Care attorney, and it was super useful.  Everyone's situation is different, and laws vary by state. In my case, I had some misconceptions about Medicaid and it turns out my state is actually more favorable in legislation than many. The situation is still depressing, expensive, and complex, but this meeting gave me a long-term plan and it helped to talk to an expert. 

Lastly, without being political, I just want to agree with those that say the way we are managing our senior population is very sad.  Navigating this has been extremely complex... it is taking time and money just to figure out how to make sure my mothers care is provided over her life.  The AL facilities seem very corrupt to me. I know they are a business, but in my mother's case, the cost of living and care is massive compared to what you get.  I hope we see a shake up in the coming years, boomers (and even GenX) will start to age out and I'm not sure the general population is ready for these costs and the volume of people impacted.

For context, my mother was her full time caregiver, and I offered support about 2-3 times a week. We did not get a lot of help from nurses or hospice until the last 48 hours, and even then we were mostly alone. I was able to be with her until the end, which was a real honor and blessing.

1amhx1l,Dementia,End Stages are Horrific,"My MIL was somewhat mobile and able to eat and drink etc before she had a bad chest infection the week before Christmas. She was taken in to hospital and her dementia massively worsened.

She has been home for about 10 days and she‚Äôs really in decline. She barely eats or drinks. She is totally bed bound. She‚Äôs always angry and now punches and bites. She HATES nurses and carers and attacks them physically and verbally.

Since she‚Äôs been home, she gets worse every day. From early afternoon she gradually gets worse and worse and we are unable to comfort or console her. She just gets more confused, more agitated and angry.

It has gotten to the point now where if she‚Äôs awake, she‚Äôs just in a mess. Wringing her hands, constantly calling out, confused, asking to go home, gets increasingly angry, constantly says she‚Äôs frightened and this just gets worse as the day goes on.

It‚Äôs horrible because there is nothing you can say or do to help reassure or comfort her.

For the first 4 days she was home we tried to manage it (there‚Äôs only me, my GF and my FIL) ourselves but recently the only thing the nurses can do is sedate her. It‚Äôs horrible. The nurse comes and sedates her. Every 4 hours from 9am to 9pm carers come and do her personal care which upsets her and the nurse has to come out and sedate her again.

This is all it is now. If she‚Äôs awake she‚Äôs just a mess. First thing she does is try to pull out her catheter. She‚Äôs made herself bleed for the last 3 days.

Even though we are doing the right things, for the right reasons it still feels shit.

1kqb9rg,Dementia,I know this might seem morbid - why do some people with dementia due quickly and other people takes years and years,"One of my grandmother's had alzemhiers. She lived until her early 90s with my uncle caring for her in her home. 

Another grandmother likely had dementia but it wasn't her memory that was affected. It was her behaviour and she lived until her mid 80s with the last few years in a care home. 


I can't remember if this was 18 months ago approx or 2 or 2 and half years ago.  I was helping a neighbour (A) in their home. One of them is a male medical professional- doctor. One of our other aging neighbours (let's call him (Y) came knocking at neighbours A door. He was looking for A the doctor to give him an injection.  He explained that he did not want the injection for the lady in the GP practice. I explained that A is not at home right now but I will pass on the message. 

I chatted with A and we found it puzzling because A is not a pharmacist and we don't know what injection or medicine Y was talking about. We presume it was a flu or covid injection.   

A made some phone calls to the local public health nurse to push it back onto her and to his GP practice.  

I remember thinking that day - he must be going senile.  It wasn't normal behaviour. 

He's dead now.  I don't know what his health is like to be honest but I reckon he had dementia. He went very downhill in the 1-2 years before he died. 


How come he went quickly? Within a year or two of my suspicions.  

Yet, he are am three and half years on this path with my mother.  Having a strong suspicion with a long list of behaviours from her and but she still hasn't progressed and still not diagnosis?

I see so many people talking about how they‚Äôre at peace and feel relief that their elderly parent/grandparent has finally passed away at some 70/80 year old age but I just feel like I‚Äôve been absolutely fucking robbed. My mom was my best friend, she was a dancer, incredibly sharp witted, a nurse of over 20 years who was with 100s of people as they died, she taught me my love of music, I rode with her on the back of her motorcycle. 

And now she‚Äôs just gone. She‚Äôll never get to meet the person I might marry someday, hold my children, watch me grow into a man of my own. It just feels so cruel. She was too fucking young, and too incredible.

My only peace is that she wasn‚Äôt unrecognizable when she passed. One of the last things she did was take my hand while I was playing her some music and danced with me.

1ks49fe,Dementia,My family is pretending that I am not in early stage dementia.,"I'm 70 years old and I can feel my mind going.  My memory is just terrible but more than that I find myself starting to not understand normal things.  The other day I lost my credit card at the gas pump because I put it in slot where the receipts come out, the attendant was quite nice about helping me get my card back and not condescending at all.  Another day I was driving along when I suddenly I had no idea where I was, I mean no idea, after about 5 to 10 seconds I saw a land mark and it all came back to me.

I can't really talk to my family about this because they are in denial.  I have rather minor type 2 diabetes and whenever I am acting squirrely (our cute euphemism for confused) they say it is blood sugar.  We have talked to maybe 4 different doctors that said based on my blood sugar this is not the cause, but there was one nutritionist that said a rapidly changing levels of glucose can cause confusion.  So they have ignored the doctors and put all of the trust in the nutritionist.  I am fine with them refusing to believe that I am experiencing dementia, because it is a scary thing to have to deal with.  Both my mother and her brother died of Alzheimer.  I don't think there is really anything you can do about dementia so it is not a problem that they are taking this route to help them deal with the situation.

The issue is I can't talk to them about what's going on in my head.  Other issues is when do I quit driving or doing other task that could endanger myself and others.  Will it become obvious to my family when this time comes so this is a nonissue?

Hopefully this post makes sense I have edited it twice.  Any advice would be appreciated.  If there is anything else that you need to know just ask.  Thanks.

Edit.  I really am overwhelmed by the kind words and great suggestions.  I have been way to passive on this problem.  I am searching for neurologists to get a real diagnosis and possibly some real help.  I wish I could accurately convey how much your support has meant to me.  I hate how emotional I have become over the last year, tears are in my eyes as I am writing this.  Thank you so damn much.  I will update or post again after I see the neurologist.  Did I mention that I want to thank you all (ha ha).

Edit.  Not sure if this how you update.  My wife and I had a good discussion yesterday.  She wanted to make sure that I told her when I had bad days and when I was having cognitive problems.  She has come to realize that it is dementia and it's not a diabetes issue.  I have an appointment with a neurologist and acceptance by my wife.  So this is all good.

1lf44pq,Dementia,"For those whose parent(s) have dementia: thinking back, were there any signs of memory loss/problems earlier in their life, or was it sudden?","My mom is 60. She has been working full-time as a university professor my (26F) whole life and is very intelligent. My mom is way more physically and socially active than I am; playing tennis weekly, going out to eat with her girlfriends, etc. My mom doesn't drink (unless she's at a wedding or some special event) and has never done drugs. She recently finalized her divorce after 15+ years of marriage. It was toxic and stressful. Starting when I was a preteen, my mom and I traveled abroad at least once a year and explored new countries and cultures. Our family doesn't have a history of any memory issues. My mom's mom (my grandma) is 90 and still kicking--very high functioning and mentally and physically active.

For the last 5-10 years, I've noticed my mom act out of character sometimes. I often attributed her odd actions to stress from her marriage, but she has been single now for over a year and I still witness her do weird things. I don't want this post to be too long, so I will try to summarize it the best I can:

* My mom and I often have long phone calls since we do not live in the same state. A lot of times, she will tell me very important stories about her personal life (stories that she maybe would only tell 2 or 3 people max). I will give her advice or my opinion on the matter, which I know she hears and understands because we'll go back and forth, just like any other normal convo. If we talk again, let's say, 2 days later, she will start to tell me the same exact story (but change some small details, i.e., what someone said or how a person acted). I normally let her talk and wait and see if there comes a point where she says ""Oh, I'm sorry, I remember we talked about this already"" or ""Oh I forgot I told you"" or something, but she almost never catches herself. Personally, if I only told 2 or 3 people about a certain private situation, I think I would remember who I told and who I didn't...but this seems hard for her.
* Starting around 10 years ago while we would travel together, my mom wouldn't be able to remember how to get back to our hotel/resort room. This often happened if we were saying somewhere huge/a large property, so I kind of just let it go. We would also explore a few streets in a city, for example, and go back to those same streets the next day or a few days later, and she couldn't navigate the streets alone. It's like she didn't recognize the places we already saw? I'm talking normal places, not statues or monuments--more so the streets surrounding the bigger things.
* I recently had to take over planning travel because of her lack of attention to detail. For example, she would constantly book flights departing at 3am, but then tell me our flight is at 3pm, and we would miss the flight. I've had to constantly ""double check her work"" because of things like this. If there are two cities with similar names but in two different countries, she'll be looking for hotels the wrong country. 
* I send my mom my college class schedule over and over. I send it as a picture (neatly organized into a weekly schedule, listing the class name and times, color coded) and I also text her every time she asks. She will literally ask me 2x within the same week.
* My mom does really weird things in public sometimes. I went to the bank with her the other day and we walked inside. Just like most banks, the inside of our bank is divided half and half--on one side, there are cubicles/desks and chairs to sit down and meet with a representative, and the other side is where you wait in line to go up and speak to a teller. The bank was pretty much empty and no one was in the teller line. There was 1 teller window open who was already helping a customer, so my mom had to wait. My mom literally stood ALL the way back behind where the waiting line post/rail/ropes start. Instead of snaking 3-4 times through an empty line and waiting near the teller area, she waited so far away and almost all of the way to the exit doors. Every 10 seconds or so, people walked in, obviously wanting to get in line to speak to a teller, but these people formed a line behind my mom. I sat there and watched her stand almost ""blocking"" the entrance to the (empty) teller line, completely ignoring the sound of people behind her. Eventually, when there were like 7 people lined up so far behind her that they were almost out of the door, a gentleman asked her to please move forward and walk through the line. Instead of laughing it off or apologizing, she gave the man a blank stare and just said ""okay"" and snaked through the empty line. Like what???
* She will order things to be delivered to my apartment sometimes. For the last 3 years, I've been living in apartment 301. My address is auto-saved in our shared Amazon account, she has it saved in her Google Maps account, etc. But then she gets things sent to apartment 302 CONSTANTLY. Or forgets to even put an apartment number. Then I have to go on a manhunt for her packages. 
* I've been married for 5 years and changed my last name immediately after marriage. When filling out legal documents (i.e., listing both of our names on a car title), she will list my maiden name. Also on the insurance. Also on the registration. But then will send me mail using my correct last name??
* She doesn't enjoy when I ""correct"" her unfavorable social behaviors (I only do this when I'm shocked my mom is doing/saying something she never would do in the past). For example, my mom brings her little dog everywhere with her. Walmart. TJMaxx. To a freaking restaurant. And her dog is not a service dog nor a trained therapy dog. When people give her nasty looks or comment on her having a dog in the grocery cart or something, she like, snaps back, thinking she's valid for doing what she wants with her dog. I don't know, it's just so unlike her to lack empathy and social awareness. I absolutely LOVE dogs, but I feel so embarrassed to be with her in these situations and I definitely CAN'T tell her it's an issue without her getting extremely angry with me.

There are honestly so many other examples, but this post is long enough. I just worry about her a bit because I feel like I don't know the woman who does those kinds of things. Like, that's not my mom? Why is she messing up and forgetting some things some times, but other times, remembers? I often wonder how it affects her work life and if she is in any danger of losing her job...

So, if you didn't read this \^, that's completely fine. I just want to know if anyone ""saw the signs"" before their parent was diagnosed with a memory issue? If so, what were they?

To be honest, based on my own experience with my own mother, I am utterly traumatised on elderly care and I never want to work with older people or dementia service users.   Based on my currently role I likely won't be but it is a requirement for the course. 

I can do the caring for other families but now when its coming so close to home with my own mother showing dementia symptoms but not the common ones, it's stomach churning. 

In relation to the course, there is a heavy emphasis and focus on memory loss and strageies to deal with dementia and memory loss like memory aids and pictures. 

But this is only just one aspect of dementia.  It is so much more than just memory loss.  

But here is the course gearing future professional care givers teaching them that memory loss is the main thing to focus on.  


Then there is a dementia educator on tiktok that is unrelated to my course by the way who has explained that people with dementia, they do remember. They can remember and it's always best not to to lie because that can cause a lot of the issues that many people deal with in relation to dementia like aggression and agitation.

1lnt64m,Dementia,Coming to terms with memory loss,"Sorry so long.....just need to get this off my chest. 

My dad suffered a cardiac arrest almost 9 years ago. Miraculously, he made it through. At the time, they did prepare us that IF he woke up, we should be prepared that he would not be the same. Worst case scenario would be a vegetable situation, but more likely scenario would be he would have to re-learn how to walk, talk, eat, etc.

Again, miraculously, when he did wake up, he was pretty much all there.

Over the first couple of years, he would occasionally have memory blips. Nothing particularly frequent, maybe a handful of times a year. We just chalked it up to just the way it was going to be post-cardiac arrest.

Over the last couple of years, there haven't been any major memory issues. But, his temper has amped up. He tends to get more and more frustrated. I will add.....he was pretty active, until about a year and a half ago, he broke his arm, and was unable to play pickleball, mow the yard, etc, for a really long time. He still doesn't play pickleball regularly anymore. But, we'll get to that.

They got a new TV for Christmas, and he has had a very difficult time learning how to use the remote, and will often times just turn it off and turn it back on. Or he'll go to the other room to watch the TV in there. I chalked that one up to just....difficulty to adapt to a new technology.

Over the last few months, the memory issues have come up more and more often. His health has been middle-of-the-road. He has had some issues of feeling dizzy, physically exhausted, trouble breathing. However, he has been to the hospital, they have run the battery of tests, and ultimately....don't find anything of urgent concern. His blockages have increased, but not to the percentage that they would consider a stent yet. But...it's this weird place where, the percentage is enough to cause him discomfort and symptoms.....but not high enough to do anything about it.

As of recent, his blood pressure has been particularly low. And he says he is sleepy/tired all the time. So, he went to his doctor. She took him off his blood pressure medicine to see how that goes. Our main concern up to this point is that he seems.....depressed. He doesn't talk a lot.

Last week, we were on a family vacation. One of my family members, a doctor, talked to my mom about having my Dad tested for dementia. During family pickleball, which I was there for one of the days, he was having trouble keeping score. And having trouble keeping up with whose serve it was. Which....I have trouble with that kind of stuff too. And, I personally just thought it was because there were so many new people playing, so many people there, and it was hard to sort of keep track. But, according to my family member, it had happened throughout the week. And...even though it's sometimes hard to keep track on the scoring....it's never been an issue for my Dad. The last time we played pickleball, maybe 2 years ago....he didn't have this issue. It makes me wonder if his not returning to pickleball has more to do with this than with the wrist recovery.

I find myself wondering if it's more likely that this issue has come up out of nowhere several years after the incident. Or, if it's unrelated, and my family member is right, we need to have him tested for dementia. I mean....it's a difficult situation either way. And, I am not sure what would be the worse outcome, honestly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1lnt64m/coming_to_terms_with_memory_loss/,1751240777.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1k6ux9u,Dementia,Memory Loss Patient - Advice on Tablet or Phone,"Hello, I am reaching out to this sub with a potentially unique question. My aunt had brain surgery a year ago and suffered memory loss and loss of reality, and now lives in a nursing home permanently. She has made small improvements but struggles a lot.

Are there any simple phones or tablets you might recommend to a dementia patient or elderly person who has trouble operating devices? I figure that is the closest common scenario.

We are hoping to give her access to emailing or texting us, maybe play solitaire, look at pictures, simple things like that. She feels very isolated, and while we visit her all the time, we'd love to be able to send her photos from outside life and send her messages, that sort of thing. Preferably something that doesn't need constant OS updating or anything of that sort, so it's less likely to malfunction while we aren't there.

My family greatly appreciates any ideas, and if there are other subs that might be able to help. Thank you all !!",https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1k6ux9u/memory_loss_patient_advice_on_tablet_or_phone/,1745508144.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1jbeye4,Dementia,Is this signs of early dementia or just normal memory loss?,"I can never talk to my mom about this cause she says I'm insulting her when I'm just really looking for help. She has always had a bad memory, but here lately I feel it's getting worse. 

Like she usually gets her days confused once in a while but oncei tell her what day it is she's fine. Today all day long she's thought it was Saturday even though it's Friday. She has had a switch for about as long as it's been out and she's played animal crossing the whole time. The past few days she can't even remember what button to press when she's trying to get something done and she gets mad at me when I point out she's wrong it's another button. She kept telling me I was just pressing different buttons to see if I could get it to work that's all. Why would you press other buttons if you know it's wrong?

She has a dr appointment next Tuesday and usually I work Tuesday and im off Fridays. But I told her that I switched with lady at work and im off Tuesday to take you to the dr and I work half a day Friday. She ask me when her appointment is and I tell her Tuesday (she's known for months it's Tuesday and I've reminded her multiple times the last few weeks it's tuesday) she gets mad and ask why would I make it Tuesday when I work Tuesdays, and this is not even a minute after I told her I switched. So again I'm like I just told you I switched with someone so I don't work Tuesday and I do work Friday. She's like then you should have told me instead of confusing me. I didn't say it any way that should confuse her. ""I'm off tuesday so I can take you to your appointment and I work Friday instead."" I dont know how that's confusing. 

The Dr's know she has memory problems but it's never been a huge concern of theirs. Like I don't know if their supposed to be keeping up with this but when she went on ssi she had to go to a dr about it and they said yes she has memory issues and that was it. We brought it up to the dr about a year and a half ago and they just asked her a few questions in office and they said ok yeah her memory problems are the same no change. And that was it. 

All I'm trying to is get her help if she needs it and she keeps telling  me that she doesn't need help and that all I've been saying is she's stupid and crazy, and if we tell the dr he will think she's stupid and crazy as well so she doesn't want me bringing it up to him. I'm just at a loss and im the only one that can deal with her and I don't know what to do. I have never once called her stupid or crazy I just need help.

He leads a completely normal life and even continues working; however, he is unable to remember certain events that happened a specific period of time ago.  
His short-term memory is completely normal‚Äîhe can remember recent events and those that occurred up to 1 or 2 months ago. However, if you ask him about something prior to that time frame, he is unable to recall it, as if he had never experienced it.  
Additionally, his memory is also normal regarding events he lived through from childhood up until approximately 10 years ago.  

For the past 2 or 3 years, he has had Meni√®re‚Äôs syndrome, but aside from that, he has no health issues or any other diagnosed condition.  

In terms of his personality, he has always been an extremely quiet and uncommunicative person. Lately, he has been saying that he feels quite nervous and depressed.  

His father had Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  

He has visited a neurologist without success. A brain MRI showed completely normal results, and short-term memory tests also came back normal.

I get distracted easily and often feel disoriented and lost. This then spirals into anxiety.

sotwxs,brainfog,20 years of Brain Fog/chronic fatigue and anxiety finally figured out after trying everything !,"Hi everyone , 

This is my first ever post on Reddit but I feel I owe it to everyone to let you know my journey with Brain Fog, constant fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches at base of skull , spacing out, horrible anxiety (especially when talking to people), on and off emotions and weakness (also I should mention terrible dandruff through this time period)

 So I'll try to make this short but I could go on forever. 

So basically the last 15-20 years I've had all the above symptoms happening on a daily basis. It affected my concentration at school, my ability to learn, couldnt talk to girls, trouble keeping up a conversation( good at faking paying attention but in reality i was spacing out) . I would always have horrible fatigue, anxiety, weird emotions and just a feeling of dumbness and wanting to be left alone.

In my late teens up till present day , I was a regular gym goer, became relatively fit but my energy and previously mentioned symptoms, remained. I kind of accepted it as my personality for most of my twenties until the last few years where I was becoming fed up , and knowing there was something wrong with me. 

After researching and going over the common diagnostics and solutions, I found nothing worked . 
I went Gluten, dairy, cafiene ,egg, meat and sugar free for over a year but felt minimal improvement. I began to feel convinced it had to be my hormones and maybe my Testosterone was rock bottom, but blood tests showed I was in normal range. Then I started to believe I had Crohns disease, Candida overgrowth or a thyroid issue , but everything was healthy and I did a Candida cleanse and no improvement.  

So once again I gave up and accepted my situation . Fast forward to this last year, there was a weekend I was off and my Girlfriend wanted to go out but I felt so exhausted , even though I had plenty of rest and didn't want to do anything. This really upset my Gf and she thought I was making excuses and being lazy , I told her that I'm not doing it on purpose and there's something wrong with me but I don't know what . She wasn't convinced and it led to an argument . I became so angry that I told her that I'll prove it to her that I'm not making it up. 

I decided to go into overdrive mode , repeated all the same tests , went to a neurologist and everything was normal. Finally the youtube algorithm sent me a video on cervical spine misalignement and Hallelujah that was the answer !! :) 

It turns out that when I was a child , I fell on ice and blacked out and ever since then , I cracked my neck out of habit to take the pressure off the stiffness but it became a habit till the present year and most likely caused misalignement of my c1 and c2 vertebrae which ends up compressing nerves and restricting blood flow to your brain (hence the fatigue and anxiety).  I immediately stopped cracking my neck , went to a chiropractor for neck adjustments and I can proudly say that was the cause of it all ! :) 

So if you are someone with a horrible neck cracking habit, and have no idea what caused your brain fog , stop cracking your joints and see a chiropractor.

  I hope this helps.  üôè",https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/sotwxs/20_years_of_brain_fogchronic_fatigue_and_anxiety/,1644457007.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

17F, 5.3 tall,115 pounds, White

I have been feeling more and more mentally/cognitively unwell for several months. It started off with me really not enjoying school (I used to be a straight A student). Then I started getting easily irritated at everything. Then came head/brain fog, which at first was a background annoying thing but is now really bad. The world doesn‚Äôt seem real, I feel detached and concentrating and memory are terrible (used to be amazing). I also feel confused at times. I don‚Äôt want to leave the house because it‚Äôs overwhelming. I feel like I‚Äôm going to fade away or faint. I get this feeling all the time at home too, it‚Äôs just easier to deal with when I can distract myself. This feeling is all day, every day and I can‚Äôt shake it. It‚Äôs truely horrible. My brain is there, I can feel it, but it's just hidden away under so much fog and disconnectedness that I sound brain damaged.

My Mom thought this was depression or anxiety so I saw a psychiatrist and a talk therapist and neither one helped. I have tried Zoloft for a while and that did not make a dent in what I‚Äôm feeling. I am definitely getting anxiety and depression, but it‚Äôs from this condition I am suffering, not the cause and the doctors agreed. My symptoms don't seem to increase/decrease in line with my mental state.

We have seen doctors, physicians, neurologists, gastroenterologists and psychiatrists. All of my results have come back perfectly normal. My neurologist doesn‚Äôt believe my symptoms are neurological in nature. I have had brain and body scans, and dozens of blood tests that are all normal. The two abnormalities are a sleep study, which showed mild AHI and moderate RDI. Out of desperation we tried a few weeks of CPAP with no improvements in cognitive symptoms. The other was some GERD and gastritis on a gastroscopy (she has previously been diagnosed with IBS. Both of these findings are mild.)

On sleep: As my fog got worse I did start showing signs of insomnia (I would wake up several times a night), and that has lasted for some months now. The CPAP machine did help me not have to go to the toilet so many times a night but I was still waking up several times.

We have also tried diets, as my stomach is upset and sore from time to time, but these also didn‚Äôt improve my symptoms. We tried low fodmap and low dairy and carb.

The last time I had COVID was 6 months before these symptoms started.

I am able to exercise each day, even if it‚Äôs a walk to the end of my neighborhood and back.

Physically I am OK it seems. I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with my brain.

Can anyone suggest something we haven‚Äôt considered?

1lmepcb,brainfog,"DPDR, Brain Fog, Anxiety after Binge Drinking","Hello all. I (22M) started abusing little over a year ago by drinking a wine bottle on most nights of the week. It would slowly increase e.g a wine bottle and a beer, 2 beers. This year it really got out of hand with drinking 2 bottles of wine whenever I could, sometimes drinking 3 bottles of wine a day. After a binge drink a month ago I woke up feeling extremely off. Fast heart rate, brain fog, dizzy, extreme anxiety. Felt like I was dying. The symptoms persisted but I felt better after 12 days, not 100% but I felt good enough to abuse one more time for a few days. I started feeling really bad again so I stopped, since then I've been sober for 23 days with minimal cravings, and over a month since the first time I've felt the symptoms. My brain feels numb, my life feels like a haze, I'm extremely regretful and anxious and I can't stop thinking about what I've done to myself. There have been pockets where I feel better, almost like my old self, but the vast majority has just been like this. I feel like its dp/dr but I'm worried it's just brain damage and the rest of my life will be like this. Especially worried since the symptoms seemed to kick in immediately after a binge drinking session.

Is there anyone who drank on a similar level to me, experienced something similar?

1j8piws,brainfog,"Brain fog cause of Ocd, depression and anxiety.","Hi guys I'm a 21 year old male from india,

And I have ocd since my childhood and developed anxiety attacks and depression from 2020, when anxiety attacks stopped then it triggered my depression and after that i have had terrible brain fog morning anxiety and aggression along with GERD.

I have been prescribed many antidepressants like Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Chlomipramine, Sertraline, Vortioxetine, Auvelity and many more ssri to counter my brain fog that came with low libido and emotional blunting but none of them worked.

From many reddit reviews about maoi Emsam and Parnate i got motivated and convinced my doctor who only could prescribe me seleglline oral tablets whereas Emsam patches are not available in india, after that i tried oral selegiline for days and it gave me really bad anxiety and anger issues along with heartburn and stomach burn but felt so much confident and sociable on it that i never felt on any med before, i also had good libido on it but it did not work for my depression and anxiety. ( I also tried it sublingually but it somehow was over stimulating even at the dosage of 0.65mg)

Parnate is also not available anymore in india as the company has stopped the production of Trivon Tablets.

What other options i have right now is Low Dose Naltrexone which is also not available here, it's available in 50mg (which i will have to dilute) and some combination like Vortioxetine + Bupropion to counter my situation which is found to be very effective for many persons anecdotally.

It's most likely an emergency for me as i have wasted 5 years of my life with my cognitive impairment, do you guys have any idea or combo or any medicine that could help my situation ( cognition is most important for me as I'm a young adult who's career is already doomed and need to fix it ).
I'm having really bad memory problems along with stuttering or something like that and can't recall the word i want to say or type or think also my creativity in games and sports are gone and studying is almost impossible for me.

 It all doesn't work. One thing to note, BrainFog symptoms have come since I had anxiety attacks, depression. 

 There are a lot of people in this sub who are skeptical about depressive brain fog, but I'm 100% sure depression and anxiety are the main causes. 

The weird thing is I'm not depressed right now and I don't experience panic attacks very often. I take the drug (prozac, abilify) for 3 months, but there is no improvement in the symptoms of brain fog.  Are there any symptoms (brain fog, inability to focus, fatigue) that persist after depression and anxiety episodes?  Then why am I not responding to drugs?  
I refuse any further test suggestions, because I've literally tried everything that exists on Earth and nothing is working.

Ever since then, I've been feeling very similar symptoms. On the regular, I am extremely fatigued no matter how many hours I sleep. I can sleep 6 or 15hrs, I am still very tired and feel like napping during the day. Have brain fog and trouble focusing on work. Taking many hours on a simple assignment.

1lo09q9,brainfog,I Made A 100% Recovery From 7.5 Years of Adderall Abuse Induced Brain Damage & Hormonal Deficiency (QEEG Brain Scans Included!),"**Hello friends,**

I‚Äôm writing this post to support a small‚Äîbut growing‚Äîcommunity of people who may benefit from hearing about my experience.

My goal is to present the key information clearly and directly, focusing on **how I recovered**. I want this to be as easy to read and understand as possible, especially for those who, like me, may be dealing with cognitive difficulties from past psychostimulant misuse, overprescription, or abuse. For this reason, I've written this post out in it's entirety and used **editing software** to edit and help optimise the delivery of this message of this **section**, however everything in the second section is in my own words and no **editing software** is used.

I‚Äôll be sharing what therapies and medications I tried that **did not work**, and most importantly, what ultimately brought all of my symptoms into **complete remission**.

I also welcome your feedback on how I can improve the format or content of this post‚Äîsuggestions are welcome!

I‚Äôve wrote in the title of this post **‚ÄúHormonal Deficiency,‚Äù** because it‚Äôs the best way I can currently describe my recovery experience. Although I‚Äôve seen endocrinologists and had multiple rounds of bloodwork‚Äîall of which came back within normal limits‚Äîthis label still feels the most appropriate.

*(Please note: this post is currently incomplete. Living with brain damage for 22 years has significantly impacted my career and financial stability, limiting my ability to obtain follow-up QEEG scans. However, I do plan to update this post in the future as funds become available. I wanted to get this post out as quickly as possible to let people know how I recovered!)*

My symptoms continuously developed over the course of 7.5 years and are outlined below:

**Respiratory Muscle Weakness-** It felt like I had an unbearably tight waist trainer around my torso, making breathing shallow and difficult.

**Sleeping difficulties-** I had terribly poor sleep, about 4 hours per night.

**Fatigue-** I was physically exhausted with no motivation.

**Eye Pain-** My eyes had a frustratingly, constant dull pain, the pain level being a 3 out of 10.

**Insomnia-** My body was ready for rest, but it's like my brain was refusing sleep (if that makes sense).

**Muscle Weakness-** Inability to fully contract muscles.

**Globus Sensation-** Throat pain was a 5 out of 10, it made speaking painful and exhausting.

**Memory Problems-** Really poor short term memory.

**Reduced Thought Processing Speed-** My ability to think was very slow, as well as my reaction time. It took me a few seconds to understand what someone was saying to me before I could even reply.

**Anxiety-** It was never going away, and was situationally exacerbated.

**Major Depression-** Feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, like nothing mattered- my motivation was nonexistent.

**Social Phobia-** I had an irrational fear of being around people.

**Panic Attacks-** It felt like my heart was going to pound right out of my chest, and no matter how many times they happened, I was sure I was going to die every time.

**Alexithymia-** I had trouble recognizing my own feelings- much less, even being able to describe what I was feeling to peers. This made life devastatingly meaningless- whether I was vacationing in the Bahamas, or alone in my bedroom, or at a birthday party, it didn't matter- I was empty.

**Inability to Focus or Concentrate-** I could read a page in a book, but wouldn't be able to tell you about anything I'd just read. I could try to watch a TV show, but genuinely didn't understand what was going on.

**Second Wind Before Sleep-** Mild energy increase, which obviously didn't help the insomnia.

**Inability to Make Eye Contact -** Trying to looks someone in the eyes felt like trying to look into a bright light it was actually painful.

The following photograph is my QEEG brain scan showing the results of 7.5 years of psychostimulant abuse. This information regarding the brain scan is a reiteration from my doctor, these are not my own statements as I am not an expert in QEEG. Any additional feedback is welcome from someone who may know more about what we are looking at here, and I'll add the information to th ispost.

If you look at the first line **Phase Coherence,** you'll see very little signaling toward the front and upper left of the brain scans. This is the social aspect of the brain. The signaling should not be **Blue**, which represents **fast** brain signaling, it should be **Red.** These should be **slow,** as well as very little to no signaling in other signaling types. If you look at the second line, you'll see **Red** signaling. These signals should be **Blue**, not **Red,** and you can see similar patterns in the first line.

This brain map **IS NOT MY BRAIN.** This is a photograph of a screen which shows a normal brain scan that I took while I was in the office. It's not a perfect photo, but it allows you to make a comparison. I plan on replacing this with my own updated brain scans. Notice the signaling colors are inverted and correct.

**(The narrative below has not used editing software)**

After I stopped using Adderall at the age of 24, I thought everything would eventually go back to normal with time. I was dead wrong. Day after day, I continued to face the repercussions of the abuse. My life was a living hell and became entirely about figuring out what happened to me. I had lost the mental capacity for anything to matter to me. The only thing that mattered was overcoming this obstacle. It consumed 100% of my thinking; I thought about how I could recover all day, every day. With my very limited thinking capacity, I began to do as much internet research as possible. I didn't know I had brain damage, and the online resources available at the time were sparce. Everything related to psychostimulant abuse was deemed **permanent** by medical professionals. I went to doctors, psychiatrists, socialogists, and endocrinologists, all of which only suggested anti-anxiety medications and anti-depressants. Those essentially had no effect on the underlying issue and left me with additional side effects for years after discontinuing the medications. The only thing I could do with my time was **jog** or **bike,** which would make me feel like I had accomplished something. It would make me feel good for an hour or two, but then would **exacerbate** all of my symptoms for 4 to 6 hours after. **Yes**, **Exercise Made My Symptoms Worse!** Keep in mind, I didn't know what was wrong with me at the time, so I was trying everything, and I did so over the course of 15 years- I **never** gave up...

**Would Worsen Symptoms:**

\-Exercise, Caffeine, Alcohol.

**Drugs That Made No Improvements:**

\-Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Effexor, Lexapro, Seroquel, Lythium, Rameron. and Valium.

**Endocrinologist Findings:**

\-All hormone levels were normal (there was nothing they could do).

**Therapies That Had No Effects:**

\-Redlight Therapy, Exercise with Oxygen Therapy (EWOT), TMS 60 Treatments (Transmagenetic Crainial Stimulation).

**Mildly Helpful with Lasting Results:**

\-Fasting. I would fast 2 days per week and experience mild symptom alleviation.

\-Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (Mild and Medical Grade).

\-NAD + IV (I wish I could've explored this more, but didn't have the means).

**My Cure**

I think it's important to do a lot of explaining here, as my cure was not instant- it happened slowly over the course of 2 years. I didn't want this section to be glanced over in fear that someone who could benefit from hearing this would shrug it off.

Please hear me out, because I assure you, it wasn't what I was expecting to put all of my symptoms into 100% remission and turn back 7.5 years of psychostimulant abuse and 22 year of symptoms that I was told were permanent, but it was quite simply... **Weight Lifting.** And again, if you missed it earlier in this post, I want to emphasis once again that it was **NOT EXERCISE** but **Weight Lifting.** I'll go into detail and give you an explaination on my stages of recovery. Some workouts gave me more of a ""brain pump"", which would wake up small parts of my brain incrementally. I could feel my brain becoming more and more ""online"" with certain workouts. However, other workouts would stimulate the release of the hormone for only a short period of time- and its absence resulted in breathing difficulties, fatigue, muscle weakness, social phobia, insomnia, and globus sensation. I would feel different symptoms alleviate from the hormonal release I was getting as opposed to the ""brain pump"".

**1 to 3 Months**

The first time a friend pressured me to go to the gym with him, I reluctantly agreed. I was always exhausted, so physical activity was always so difficult. I mean, getting out of bed was hard, let alone lifting weights! So I went to the gym and did various workouts: dumbell curls, dumbell press, leg press, and more. After having left the gym that day, I felt a pressure in my head- a good pressure, like I was gaining stimulation in areas of my brain that were once nonfunctional. I felt good, **really** good. And even after this one gym session, I knew if I was going to recover, weight lifting was going to play a role in it. I continued to lift weights, and after every workout, I felt a little better the next day. My sleep was slightly better, and even my ability to concentrate was getting somewhat better, day by day.

**3 to 6 Months (The Hormone)**

About three months in, feeling better and better each day, something unexpected happened when I was working out. I was doing lat pull downs, and suddenly, I felt a warm sensation in my stomach and noticed an immediate increase in my thinking speed. My obstacle of slow thinking finally had a dent in its armor. I could now think faster, but it was after the feeling of my endocrisystem (I'm assuming adrenal glands and thyroid) stimulating that brought it on. I found in that moment that weight lifting was stimulating something that exercise was not.

**6 to 12 Months (The Secondary Hormone)**

About 6 months into weight lifting, I went into the gym and started my normal routine. This time, I started with bench press. I was on my very last set, and was forcing the bar up with every ounce of strength I had. After I got the bar back on the rack, I immediately felt a cold sensation in my torso, in the areas of my abdomen that were constantly tight and weak and making breathing difficult. I was excited and in shock- the sensation felt better than any drug I had ever taken. I felt more awake and alive than I'd ever felt before. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was what my body was missing. I went to sleep that night and had the best sleep I'd had in over 20 years. At that point, my life focus had changed. I needed this hormone, I had to have it, it made me feel **good** again. What made me have a good day or bad day was dependant on the amount of this hormone that I had gotten that day. Throughout this period, I found there was a difference in workouts- between what would stimulate the release that gave me this incredible sensation, and what would give me more of a ""brain pump"", and get new parts of my brain ""back online"". The variety of workouts that I would do was quite limited, but to me it wasn't about muscle gains, it was about what was fixing my brain and correcting this apparent hormone problem. In these workouts, I went for volume over weight. The longer the set, the more the hormone would release, so I'd do 4 sets of 15 reps.

**""Brain Pump"" Workouts**

\-Bench press

\-Dips

\-Chest flys

**Hormone Stimulation Workouts**

Later on, I experienced the release of the hormone with just about every workout that I did, and the one in particular that gave me the greatest amount of the hormonal release was **Sled Pulls.** I did sled pulls every single day in search of these hormonal releases I'd experience after each set.

\-Lat Pulls

**1 Year to 2 Years**

At the end of 2024, I decided that I was going to go through another Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy series. The only affordable one was a mild Chamber, and throughout this month I did about 40 treatments. The **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy** series vastly excelerated what weight lifting was doing for me. I would get more of a ""brain pump"" during my workouts and would experience a greater amount of hormonal stimulation during this period. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy during this time was not stand alone effective for what I was dealing with, however it was miraculous along side **Weight Lifting**.

Today, as of 06/26/25 (22 years later) I can proudly say I am symptom free from all of the symptoms listed above! I feel incredible! This concludes my first draft! I plan on updating this post with additional descriptions with my ""after"" brain scans of course, along with formatting updates. I believe I've given enough information to give those struggling a testimonial of a full recovery- and hope. Hang in there guys! It's a work in progress.

cax0l9,brainfog,panic attack induced brain fog disappeared over time,"I'm just writing this here to provide those suffering with a similar affliction to have some modicum of assurance that recovery is at least possible. I'm not saying it is guaranteed because I don't know if it is, but I certainly recovered after experiencing a pretty bad panic attack that caused brain fog 

If memory serves me well, it took me around 5 weeks to recover. Perhaps 1/2 weeks more or less. Truth be told, I have no idea what was happening, although online research through reddit and the such (so people with similar experiences) seem to think this process is the brain essentially trying to 'heal' from a past trauma. I'm absolutely not accredited to make any serious claims on the matter, but I think it's likely my brain was trying to reorganise its chemistry in some manner. 

I feel as though my not fixating on the issue helped me substantially. I.e. for a while it was almost all I was capable of thinking of but eventually I thought of it less and less. Recovery was also somewhat sudden I think? Eventually things got much clearer, rather than progressively in numerous time increments. Luckily, I had no work commitments during this time so I had ample rest, and perhaps this was significant.

For those wondering what it was like, my brain fog felt inexplicable. At the time I described it as though 'someone had poured a litre of lead into my head'. I think that was an apt description, however I'd also add that it felt like my cognitive capacity had diminished. Although on reflection I don't think that was the case, rather it just felt as such. 

I struggle to remember the exact anguish, but during this ordeal I certainly remember feeling very hopeless throughout. I've experienced 2nd degree burns, and I think I'd rather re-experience that pain again than live through the brain fog a second time.

And as a side note: to the long-term sufferers, I sincerely hope you manage to find a path out of this, and my heart goes out to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/cax0l9/panic_attack_induced_brain_fog_disappeared_over/,1562653351.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1g3e79u,brainfog,"Your breathing could be the reason for your brain fog, let me tell you why. ","How are you **breathing**?

This might sound like a **stupid question** because many people don't think about their breath unless they are sick or having a ""traditional"" panic attack.

We take our breath for granted; it just happens in the background. But your breathing is a **behavior** that has been learned based on your life.

Our breathing behavior can cause **brain** **fog**.

I know this because I had brain fog for years. Following a 9.0 **earthquake**, I developed high levels of stress that turned into terrible **anxiety**. This changed how I breathed, and then my breathing fuled my anxiety.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why **over-breathing** (hyperventilation) can lead to brain fog:

**1. Less CO2 = Narrowed Blood Vessels (Vasoconstriction)**  
When you breathe too much, you exhale more **carbon dioxide (CO2)** than your body needs. CO2 isn‚Äôt just waste; it helps relax and open your blood vessels. If you lose too much CO2, the blood vessels in your brain constrict (tighten).

With narrowed vessels, **less blood and oxygen reach your brain**, making it harder to focus, think clearly, or process information‚Äîcausing that foggy feeling.

**2. Reduced Oxygen Delivery (The Bohr Effect)**  
Even if you‚Äôre getting enough oxygen by breathing a lot, **your body can‚Äôt use it properly** without enough CO2. Normally, CO2 helps hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying molecule in your blood) release oxygen to the cells.

When CO2 levels drop, hemoglobin holds onto oxygen, so **your brain cells don‚Äôt get the oxygen they need**. This lack of effective oxygen delivery contributes to that sluggish, foggy, and confused feeling.

**3. pH Imbalance (Respiratory Alkalosis)**  
Low CO2 causes your blood to become more **alkaline** (less acidic), a condition called **respiratory alkalosis**. This pH imbalance affects how your nerves and muscles function, leading to symptoms like **dizziness, numbness, and brain fog**. Your brain just isn‚Äôt operating at full power.

**4. Nervous System Overload (Sympathetic Activation)**  
When you over-breathe, your body stays in **fight-or-flight mode** (the sympathetic nervous system). This mode is designed for survival, not thinking clearly. It shifts your energy toward physical responses (like heart rate and muscle tension) and away from calm, focused thinking, leaving your brain feeling cloudy and slow.

1lt3jf7,brainfog,Brain fog after extreme stress and loss of loved one but also chronically ill?,"It's really hard to determine the cause of my brain fog because I've got so many things going on, I'm chronically ill with cfs/me, fibro, MCAS, cirs, PCOS, likely in peri-menopause, among other things but I also just lost a loved one horrifically, am functionally homeless, lost a dream job, and alone without support. 

How many of you developed brain fog from psychological stressors alone and is there anyone else that has both chronic illness and also extreme stress and how did you figure out your causation? 

My brain fog developed about 4 weeks ago although it's been on and off for several years but not as severe. I can't really think critically at all, my working and short term memory is horrible, I can't put sentences together or read easily. It feels like a floating feeling 24/7 just empty head. Im not myself anymore, I feel like my brain stopped working completely or like I have a TBI, but I didn't sustain any head trauma.

The job I lost was a PhD in the sciences, I need my brain to move forward and get out of homelessness because my brain has been all I have in life to rely on. My intelligence is the one thing that's kept me alive during my life, which has been difficult.

Anyone else relate?

1k9twcm,brainfog,"Struggling with Work Stress, Confidence, and Brain Fog Need Advice","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm feeling really overwhelmed and need some help. I‚Äôm so stressed at work and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

In my previous company, my boss used to yell at me constantly. The environment was abusive, and over time, I lost my confidence and even my ability to speak clearly. I started developing anxiety over even small things. I also noticed that after the extreme stress, my memory became really bad.I started forgetting things that I normally wouldn‚Äôt. It became unbearable, so I finally switched jobs.

At my new job, things were okay for the first two months. But after that, people started showing their true colors, and the environment has become horrible again. No one gives me proper training. When I ask my boss for help, he talks so fast and never explains things clearly. He assigned an engineer to help me, but whenever I ask questions, he says things like, ‚Äúno offense, but I have work to do too.‚Äù Sometimes he explains, but other times he says mean or discouraging things.

Because of all this, my stress levels have skyrocketed. I‚Äôm not able to perform well. My confidence is completely shattered. My brain feels fogged and frozen even doing simple math has become hard for me, and that‚Äôs terrifying because math was something I was always good at. I was a straight-A student, graduated with a 3.97 GPA in my master‚Äôs degree. I know I‚Äôm not dumb but right now, I feel dumb because of how badly stress is affecting me.

Now, the engineer has even made comments like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know how to do 7th-grade math,‚Äù which crushed me even more. It feels awful.

I‚Äôm planning to leave this job after 4 months and relocate somewhere else if possible. But honestly, I just need advice how do you deal with this kind of stress when your confidence is destroyed and your brain is frozen? Has anyone been through something similar and recovered?

199xros,brainfog,I irreversibly damaged my brain with chronic sleep deprivation and over-stressing myself,"I  am, or perhaps was, a high-achiever. I wanted that sweet gratification  from being on top of something, anything, just to be validated and worth  to someone since I was worthless to myself. I sleep-deprived myself for  2 years in order to achieve some personal goals. To be specific, I was  sleeping on average 5 hours and was working constantly like a machine, I  even pushed away some people from my life in order to make more room  (time) for my goal. On top of that, I had issues with some people who  out of sheer competitiveness, worked against me since we had the same  goal. It made me depressed, and I went to and out of bed every day quite  miserable. At least, I was progressing towards my goal, until one  day...

I remember quite vividly I  felt fatigued and exhausted like never before, and it was the exhaustion  of quality I never experienced before, like every cell in my body was  tired. What cognitive ability went first was attention, followed by  short-term memory issues. I was not able to pay attention to anything,  my short-term memory was almost non-existent, and I had a sense like my  brain did a full restart, wiping out a huge database of information I  gathered throughout my lifetime. I was having huge trouble recollecting  trivial information, and for some information, I knew before, I had a  sense that they are no longer in my brain. That feeling of memory recall  being on top of your tongue was absent. Since short-term memory was  also shattered, I was having trouble remembering trivial behavioral  intentions. I was catching myself in the middle of something, knowing  full well that I was fulfilling some intention, some goal, only for it  to be forgotten in the short time span. Horrifying experience.

The  onset of this episode was accompanied by hair loss on my scalp, for  which I sought help from a dermatologist. He prescribed my Finasteride,  and I was on this medication for more than a year. I also developed  sleep issues, where I was having trouble sleeping, and was unable to  sleep more than those mythical 5 hours. For my sleep issues I was  prescribed Ambien. Third issue was regarding my libido which was gone.

I  started to exercise regularly and that put my depression into  remission, but my cognitive impairment persisted and I was still without  libido. I took Ambien for about 6 months and then stopped since I  managed to recover my sleep habits. I was on Finasteride more than a  year, and I stopped it after I found out about all the negative  side-effects it was associated with.

Five  (5) years later, I'm without depression, but I feel like it's  constantly lurking in the background, and regular physical activity is  keeping it at bay. I don't have a depressive mood, but I'm unmotivated,  highly cynical, empty inside, with frequent suicidal ideation, and with  obvious anhedonia. Both short-tem and long-term memory only slightly  improved. I'm having huge issues with recollecting names, and what is  probably even worse, my capacity for abstract thinking is severely  damaged, like I lost 20 IQ points during this nightmare. My ability to  formulate thoughts and construct sentences feels like gone. When I'm  having conversations, I have thoughts, but it feels like the brain  module for converting them into language is missing. I genuinely feel  stupid, and this feeling forces me to isolate and avoid people, since  I'm afraid they will notice something is not okay. My brother noticed  I'm having issues with memory, but I didn't disclose my situation to  anyone, yet. I feel like I developed dementia in early 30s and it's  devastating. I feel like future is robbed from me and that I don't have  anything to live for.

I'm very  familiar with clinical psychology, and I know that science doesn't have  the tools to deal with short-term memory issues, which are almost as a  rule irreversible. I did MRI scan to make sure I didn't develop any  brain tumor and the finding was negative. Considering everything  together, that I did the worst thing imaginable for the brain, i.e.  depriving it from sleep, and that I was on a drug (Finasteride) that  affects neurosteroids, drug that is associated with cognitive  impairments in the form of medically unofficial diagnosis (Post  Finasteride Syndrome), I really don't know if there is any help for me. I  don't even know where to seek answers to what happened to me, and I  don't know for how long will I be able to keep on going like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/199xros/i_irreversibly_damaged_my_brain_with_chronic/,1705604458.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1cr87s8,brainfog,Stress induced brain fog ,"I‚Äôm at my wits end and need some success stories to force me to believe this isn‚Äôt going to be my life forever. 

About ten years ago I started experiencing brain fog. At first it only happened every couple of weeks, but gradually increased to every day. 

It‚Äôs now been ten years and I have experienced this brain fog, light headedness, tinnitus, feel alot of pressure in my forehead when I look up with my eyes,  sore neck, loss of memory for peoples names or plans, inability to focus or learn or remember new tasks, jittery hands, muscle twitches, almost feels like I am high from marijuana.  It seriously debilitating and affecting my work, relationships and essentially ruining my entire life. I tried moving a friends vehicle the other day and didn‚Äôt start it before putting it in drive and almost had it crash into another persons vehicle, I started changing my light bulbs in my car and didn‚Äôt even think of which light was burnt out before starting to take things apart. I don‚Äôt understand simple instructions and ask super dumb questions and it‚Äôs because I feel like this all the time. 

I feel like I have tried so many things to figure it out. 

I have gone for an mri on my head,  eye appointments. X-rays on my chest, worked out everyday, drank more water, don‚Äôt drink caffeine, drink alcohol maybe once a month, smoke weed maybe once every few months, did a 30 day strict eating protocol, have had my blood tested for multiple things, chiropractor, massages, acupunctures and taken venlafaxine (anxiety depression meds). 

I have a feeling that it has a lot to do with stress, because anytime I feel even the tiniest bit of stress it gets so much worse. The stress can even be from playing a board game and it did seem a bit better when I take venlafaxine. But my neck is also super sore all the time which might be from a car accident I had about 13 years ago and the chiropractor said my neck is super straight with no curvature. I have read some peoples brain fog can be cured from chiro if it‚Äôs their vertebrate that‚Äôs causing the issue but I do think mine might be stressed induced. 

I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore. I have an easy at home job, with no kids, so my life is essentially stress free and yet every day I feel like this and I need it to stop. Because if this continues on I think I‚Äôm gonna have to blow my brains out. Please send me recommendations of what worked for you.

1hogkjg,brainfog,Depressed due to poor cognition,"Hello reddit, I‚Äôm writing this today because I am simply at the end of my rope. I have spent the past five years being hopelessly miserable, watching my mental health deteriorate with each passing day. As of right now, I am suicidal and honestly, I would have ended it by now if I weren‚Äôt too cowardly to do so. I spend many days in bed lying in the darkness doing absolutely nothing, I can detach from my body and mind and simply exist in a state of nothingness where I have no thoughts or emotions. When I am not in this state, I am permanently locked in this dissociative haze which is characterized by a dream-like perception and severe cognitive difficulties. Herein lies the root of my suffering. Over the past few years, I have developed and solidified the belief that I am unintelligent and incapable of tasks requiring critical thinking.

Allow me to provide some context. When I was in high school, I was a poor student until my dad told me that I needed to study harder otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to college. From that point on I studied very hard and received good grades in nearly every subject. Unfortunately, along the way, I developed a bit of an ego and, it being in the formative years of my life, I developed an identity around being intelligent which unbeknownst to me became a huge source of my self-worth. However, in the few years following my graduation from college, I started to realize small things that chipped away at my self-esteem. I noticed that my peers were often able to grasp concepts with more ease than I could. I noticed that I seemed to lack common sense in many situations (I would ask obvious questions, I couldn‚Äôt troubleshoot simple mechanical issues, etc.). Over time I started to realize more and more of these things such as my difficulties with mental math, my challenges with navigating roads, and my inability to follow the plotlines of TV shows and films. Before long, I did some investigating and came across the concept of IQ, or general intelligence. After reading about it for a while, it didn‚Äôt take long for me to piece together that all these things are influenced by intelligence and I was soon buried by the weight of the crushing realization that I was never really all that smart, I just worked harder than my peers. I‚Äôve been distraught over this every single day for years and not once has the burden become any wieldier

. Not only does it make any modicum of self-esteem practically impossible, but it also makes everyday life dull and tiresome. I struggle with games because I get confused easily and I can‚Äôt figure out how to improve, I struggle working minimum wage jobs since I can‚Äôt problem solve by myself and can‚Äôt remember correct procedure, and I struggle conversating since it‚Äôs hard for me to focus on what is being said to me and the meaning behind it.

Anyways if you made it through all this, thank you for reading. I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on where to go from here because like I said I‚Äôve basically just given up all hope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1hogkjg/depressed_due_to_poor_cognition/,1735423467.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

About 5ish years ago, I started feeling something like a pinched nerve in my neck. (It was on the right side) Things stayed like that for awhile, it gave me just a little bit of brain fog, so little that i don think i even really noticed just kind of put it off as exhaustion or anxiety. But then recently I hurt the left side of my neck and things have gotten so much worse, it's been 6 months since i hurt the other side of my neck and i get terrible brain fog and feel so out of it. Focus, concentration, communication skills, walking and balance. I just feel off. I always thought it just felt like it needed to get cracked in the right direction and i'd be all better. 

I've done PT, NUCCA, a couple chiros (although they seemed pretty bad), acupuncture, and lots of stretching. I do want to admit that my symptoms have maybe improved a little, im not cured yet though.

I hear people saying that its forward head posture, atlas misalignment, other things, and i'm hoping we can communicate under this post to talk about potential causes/solutions.

I figured if anyone comments under this we can start a group chat either DMs on reddit or discord, instagram, anything! and form a huge groupchat. There are people out here dealing with similar issues and if anyone finds a solution that could change everything for us.

1l68m8n,brainfog,I hadn't gotten any medical attention from a migraine that lasted for an entire month and now I'm worried about Dementia,"I've had a headache since early of may or possibly even earlier than that and I kept asking my parents to take me to a clinic or a hospital because I've been having this headache where the pain ranges from mild to moderate. Yet they kept ignoring me and denying me and even get mad at me for asking even though I've been in chronic pain for more than 72 hours which is the normal time range for a migraine.

Not just a migraine but I've also been having other issues as well such as a left lip that feels pulled, numbness and weakness in my body, pain in my jaw, my left eye twitching, slight slurring and not to mention brain fog.

When I searched about it I learned that they could possibly be a sign of a silent stroke which is a stroke that occurs that causes less damage than a silent stroke but less likely to be noticed which as a result is just as bad as a regular stroke if not worse. And the consequences of it being untreated is an increased risk of more strokes and even vascular dementia.

I literally showed about this potential issue to my parents and surprise surprise they denied me yet again and say that I'm a negative thinker even though my pain is clear because there's no possible way I could have gotten a prolonged migraine and have that be normal. It's not.

Not to mention I've noticed my brain getting weaker and at one point I confused my mother and my mother's friend even though they're wearing different clothing, pressing the wrong icons multiple times and even misspelled words that are easy.

I mean I can still walk, talk, remember and think but seeing those issues have me worrying, especially since it's been a month since I have gotten checked.

And mind you in 19 years old, still live with my parents and have no finances of my own. I could have gotten help myself but I don't have the money nor do I have anyone around me who can actually understand my situation.

And yes I do know that I have OCD and Health Anxiety but these issues especially a long headache shouldn't be ignored.

Now I'm scared because I feel like my brain is destroying itself and no one is even bothering to help. I know that in probably just overreacting because the chances of getting Dementia at my age is very very low (as in 2-8%) but having it low doesn't mean it's 0, especially with what I am feeling right now.

I don't want to end up like that, I still have so much to live for. I wanted to get help but nobody is willing to lend a hand because unless I can't walk or talk anymore, they'll just assume that I'm overreacting. Especially since I'm young.

TLDR: I've been having an untreated headache that has been lasting about a month, learned that silent strokes exist and now my paranoid mind is worried about the possibility of early onset dementia.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1l68m8n/i_hadnt_gotten_any_medical_attention_from_a/,1749376936.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1l8cptw,brainfog,I'm really scared of the possibility of Dementia because of chronic untreated headaches that I can feel from my veins,"Even though I'm only 19 years old, the possibility of early onset dementia really scares me because I've been having this headache for an entire month and it has been unresolved.

Not just a headache but I've also experience other things such as a slightly pulled left lip, numbing body parts, stiff neck and a perpetually twitching eye. It has gotten so bad that I'm convinced that I'm having or had a stroke (a silent variant) and it hasn't been treated for a month and now I'm worried because the consequences of an untreated silent is vascular dementia.

I'm really scared because I noticed my cognitive ability has declined so much lately, I notice making spelling mistakes more, putting places at the wrong area and I even notice myself becoming more stressed, uncoordinated and agitated last night which is literally known as sundowning when I had to go with my parents last night. I don't know if it's because they've been ignoring me when I told them about my issues for a month or is my am I becoming senile that quick.

I'm starting to think that I am vulnerable to it and makes me want to get checked for it even more but I feel like it would be too late at this point.

I mean early of may I got a blood test and the doctors never informed me about thyroid issues because either that hadn't been an issue or they hadn't caught that.

Now I know that thinking you would have Dementia at a young age would be absurd but I've heard cases of that happening to even teenagers and the scary part about it is that you may not even know that wether it's on it's onset or it will happen.

1km83m4,GutHealth,Crazy IBS/IBD-Like symptoms,"Ok... so where do I even start?

I've been struggling with IBS/IBD/Malabsorption like symptoms for almost a year. I began to notice a significant change in my BM habits early last year after 2 bouts of covid back to back (novever 23' & January 24') and it progressivly got worse... in August, I went to my GP and he ordered blood work and a Fecal Calprotectin test.

The Blood work came back great, but I procrastinated getting the Calprotectin test done because I felt like it would not provide answers for me, and it wasn't covered under MSP. I figured, before taking that test that I would try and heal my body.

‚ñ™Ô∏é My diet is naturally low-dairy and low-caffeine, but i focused harder on eliminating my intake of these products more.
‚ñ™Ô∏é I've worked hard at avoiding processed foods.
‚ñ™Ô∏é  I have tried lots of supplements: probiotics, slippery elm, psyllium husk, berberine, new root's parasite purge... with very little results, if any at all.
‚ñ™Ô∏é 48hr water fast... I felt amazing until the moment I ate something. 
‚ñ™Ô∏é pepto did absolutely nothing for relief & immodium felt like I was flipping a coin, I'd often be left with a lot of my symptoms and it wasnt uncommon that i would end up feeling constipated for 48 hrs.

Note: the only time through out this all that I've experienced constipation is when I take immodium. I've had the opposite problem, and I honestly never knew humans were capable of üí© so freaking much until I started experiencing this health-change.

I finally caved and had the Calprotectin test done after a particularly brutal day, and to no surprise I had very low inflammation levels.

I've recently started taking a complete digestive Enzyme supplement and it has helped significantly, its made eating feel easier (it has been hard for me to eat, i get disgustingly full so quick) and has reduced the frequency of BM noticeably but I'm still struggling.

I went back to my doctor, he believes I have IBS (I am not convinced this is the problem) and has recommended the FodMap diet (which is pretty close to how i am already eating) and sent in a referral for a gastro specialist but it could be months before I see them. 

I'm pretty desperate for relief right now, and I'm feeling pretty hopeless... it is so bad most days that I find it hard to leave the house, I'm terrified that I'll have an emergency and not have a bathroom near by. I'm just wondering if there is any other supplement that I could try that might help me feel better until I see the gastroenterologist.

Ideally, I want to see a naturopath but it's out of the question right now. Insurance doesn't cover it and I'm not employed. üò™",https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1km83m4/crazy_ibsibdlike_symptoms/,1747202922.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1frsbol,GutHealth,"Ibs, Ibd or gluten sensivity + leaky gut?","Hello everyone! For about 6 years now I have not been very well. It started from one day to the next, first I was a healthy person, then suddenly I started to have symptoms of various kinds.

Here is a list:

- Chronic fatigue

-Joint and muscle pain

-sensations of stinging in the abdomen (peripheral neuropathy?)

- Warm feeling on the face

-feeling of fever and feeling sick, but measuring the temperature with the thermometer does not show any fever

- Intestinal irregularity, alternating constipation and diarrhea (in my case diarrhea happens very rarely a single episode months later) but I no longer have a regularity when I go to the bathroom, it can take 1, 2 or 3 or more days (when I was healthy I went once every day at the same time).

- Chronic erosive gastritis 

- temporary abdominal pain in the upper area (small intestine/stomach)

-difficulty gaining weight (malabsorption)

I did a lot of tests.

My blood tests are also perfect for inflammatory markers ESR and PCR, celiac disease negative, no allergies, markers for autoimmune diseases negative.

  The only alarming test was calprotectin which was always very high in all 4 cases (3000,900,134,418). 

So I had a gastroscopy and colonoscopy, where I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis, while in the intestine a superficial non-specific inflammation in the ileum area, it was thought to be Crohn's disease but then the enteroresonance examination was negative.

 So I was told by two gastroenterologists that it was irritable bowel and that I simply had to change my diet. 

To tell the truth, I have found benefits in removing gluten from my diet. 

In fact, during the gluten-free diet I managed to gain weight.

 I recently went to an immunologist who explained to me that given the high lymphocytes of the tests and also the high presence of antibodies against gliadian deamidated iga, it may be a gluten sensitivity to which a strong intestinal permeability would have been added which would explain the reason for my symptoms. 

So he advised me to do a test for the analysis of intestinal permeability so as to confirm or not the leaky gut. 

And also the microbiota test to fix the intestinal bacterial flora. 

I asked if high calprotectin depended on these conditions and he said yes (I knew that calprotectin depends on IBD or infections, not permeability or gluten). I have many doubts, is it worth doing these tests to try to solve the problem or do I risk wasting money unnecessarily?

As for my diet, I eat a lot of carbohydrates such as: pasta, bread, focaccia, pizza, biscuits, snacks etc ...

I'm used to this because I'm Italian but of course I know very well that I should instead increase vegetables and fruit and that probably with all these problems it certainly has to do with what I eat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1frsbol/ibs_ibd_or_gluten_sensivity_leaky_gut/,1727570136.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The good news? Emerging dietary approaches are helping. The Crohn‚Äôs Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) focuses on fiber-rich whole foods while cutting out processed items, gluten, and dairy. It reduces inflammation, restores gut balance, and improves adherence compared to restrictive diets. The Mediterranean diet and Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) are also effective strategies for managing CD symptoms and inflammation ([Chen L., et al, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11438647/)).

As someone who works closely with people managing gut health, I‚Äôve seen how much of a difference diet can make in improving symptoms and overall well-being for conditions like Crohn‚Äôs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1jcy8zy/the_western_diet_and_crohns_disease_what_you_eat/,1742165992.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

My teenage daughter recently had a nasojejunal (NJ) tube placed, which bypasses the stomach and delivers nutrition directly into the small intestine. This opens up a unique opportunity to try prebiotics and probiotics without the usual concern about stomach acid killing off beneficial bacteria 

She has a functional gastrointestinal disorder (also considered a gut-brain disorder), experiences significant anxiety, and is on the autism spectrum. At this point, she is exclusively formula fed through her NJ tube.

We‚Äôre only considering science- and research-backed supplements, and of course, anything we try will be reviewed and approved by her medical team beforehand.

That said, I‚Äôd love to hear from others who may have experience or knowledge in this area.

14srhdl,GutHealth,"Panic attacks, bloating, heart racing, sweating symptoms after eating meals.","Will start off with off saying, yes I know I should go to a doctor. And I plan on doing so. But having a general understanding as to what may be wrong provides me with better information to seek out a doctor.

I‚Äôve been highly athletic since 16. I became quite strong with occasional over training injuries. Those injuries always eventually healed and I‚Äôd be able to push a pr a few months after. About a year ago, I suddenly started experiencing endless tendon injuries. No matter how little I trained, how much I rested, or which training style I applied, my tendons kept getting worse. -to the point of being concerned of full body arthritis. In addition, about every 2 weeks I would catch flu symptoms including body aches, restlessness, sweating, and fatigue. About 6 months ago I caught salmonella. After the fact, I was left with a case of SIBO which was accompanied with additional severe symptoms. (Will get into) SIBO sent me down a line of researching gut health and understanding that gut issues likely had a huge impact on my tendon health. About 2 months ago I started developing severe panic attacks, sweating, bloating, heart racing, breathing issues (which felt related to a bloated stomach taking up space), and plethora of other random symptoms akin to a bad shroom trip. (Head spinning, minor visuals, skewed sensations, anxiety, and 0 libido) After researching SIBO, I started an elemental diet. After one week all of my methane gas, which is a key symptom of SIBO dissipated, and in fact, by the 7th day I woke up stomach pain free and had more natural energy than I‚Äôve had most of my life. I had to break my diet on my 7th night because my second elemental shipment got delayed from a Friday to the following Monday. During that time I had salmon as my first meal and went to sleep with moderate stomach pain. The next morning I ate sliced meat and began having meal induced panic attacks again. The next few days off my elemental diet dramatically escalated my symptoms. While my SIBO symptoms never came back, there‚Äôs clearly another one or couple gut issues that are at play.

Symptoms are triggered by any food including the elemental diet, although the symptoms lessen each day I stay on the diet. It feels like my gut system is inflamed and tightened/bloated and those cause the following symptoms after eating: shortness of breath, gnawing pain underneath ribs or top quadrant of abdomen, 1-2 minute heart race, 2-5 minute sweats, 5 minute panic attacks, occasional sharp pains in gut, inability to flex core due to discomfort, and frequent burping (but with no gaseous smell)

My mom and sister have had thyroid cancer, my brother has hoshimotos, my dad has the same Illness as me (but his GI doctor just said they saw inflammation in his gut, not sure where), and then there‚Äôs me.

I don‚Äôt have a history of alcohol abuse but have done some dumb low calorie diets, and used to eat lots of processed sugars when I was younger. I definitely think there is malabsorption going on as well. Pancreatitis seems most likely but I‚Äôm not experiencing severe pain as much as feeling highly aware of every bit of movement and discomfort in my gut.

1jjez4s,GutHealth,Terrible experience on Sodium Butyrate,"Hi all,

I have been dealing with GI issues for about 10 years, mostly having diarrhea almost every day and frequent cramps. I've recently made the decision to finally stop ignoring the issue and start finding the cause together with my GP. My diet in general has always been quite healthy but I've been experimenting with eliminating certain foods.

2 months ago, I read about Butyrate as a beneficial compound for its anti-inflammatory properties and its benefit for the intestinal lining. Besides eating more resistant starch I starting taking it in supplement form as well as Sodium Butyrate.

This hugely backfired. After about 2 weeks of taking 600mg of SB every day I started getting severe brain fog, dizziness and anxiety. A lot of the days it felt like I was intoxicated, some days even waking up in panic attacks. I even had to take leave on my job because I could not follow conversations or read emails anymore at some points. I have not experienced brain fog or panic attacks ever before in my life, just some anxiety related to work stress now and then.

Considering that Sodium Butyrate is generally a very safe supplement with minimal side effects, can anyone explain my massive cognitive side effects? My GP seems to have no idea and I wonder if it's related to my longer persisting GI issues or something entirely different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1jjez4s/terrible_experience_on_sodium_butyrate/,1742892968.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

* Heart palpitations ( PVC, PAC )

* Sharp chest pains  

* Brain fog + ( vertigo symptoms) 

* Anxiety and hard to concentrate 

* Nausea And Fatigue 

Explanation of my symptoms 

The main symptom I get mostly is Heart palpitations ( pvc and pac) been dealing with these for 3 years now with brakes , they come and go sometimes they occur suddenly and bother me for week or two and they are noticeable they can take my breath away for a second . 
But then they vanish for 2-3 months and come back again. it‚Äôs like a circle that I got used to it . Normally through out the day when they give me a break I get them rarely maybe 1 or two a day after a workout or long walk. 
Done multiple ECG at the GP Echo, 24h heart monitor , blood work and etc all came back fine. Ive realised that coffee and big meals cause them for me too. Also notice them in the gym after I push my self a little and get my pulse around 140 I get a feeling of a big thud in my heart with an extra beat that scares me sometimes.

Second bothersome symptom that I can call new is vertigo a sensation of being dizzy all of the sudden when walking or looking and following an abject with my eyes, also head feels heavy with brain fog which makes me hard to concentrate reading a book or doing something on my laptop. 

Other than that chest pains and other symptoms like nausea bother me maybe once a month.

I am looking for reassurance to make sure I‚Äôm not turning into a crazy person, LOL.

I am a 31 year old female. I have always had anxiety/depression since I was a kid but NOTHING compared to what I‚Äôve been experiencing since late July. I will wake up in full fight or flight mode and have no idea why. This all started randomly.
I am starting to think.. honestly it‚Äôs probably related to my gut. I did one of those Thorne stool tests and got my results back and have a lot of inflammation and bad bacteria. Not sure what to do with these results exactly or how to treat. 
I was doing really good, eating right, felt great and back to normal then had a few slip ups this past week and boom, woke up with high anxiety again yesterday and today. 

I‚Äôve done MRI scan of my brain, EKG, blood work, ultrasound on my ovaries/uterus - all normal. 

Met with a gastro and he is going to do: 
Colonoscopy and endoscopy EGD with gastric and duodenal biopsies for further workup
Sucrase breath test and SIBO breath test
Celiac panel and routine labs 
Ultrasound gallbladder

Is this a good start?

All of this most likely is due to the severe stress I went through last year. I was so stressed that I felt it physically affecting my body, and it enhanced my gut sensitivity, resulting in multiple visits to the ER (as I spotted slight blood in my stool a few times & weakness). Overall I ended up seeing a GI Specialist and did a colonoscopy and endoscopy procedure to check for any underlying issues. Thankfully I am okay and they didn‚Äôt find anything apart from slight inflammation. They did mention that I am developing IBS. 

Since last summer I‚Äôve been suffering from chronic constipation and I also struggle with eating adequate fibre. 

I am trying to get to the bottom as to why my body isn‚Äôt able to tolerable sugary foods anymore. I find it quite odd and I think that my body is still suffering from the prolonged effects of stress. No doctor has been able to really help me and idk what to do.

1hzzgba,GutHealth,"GABA: The Key to Better Sleep, Less Stress, and Gut Health","I‚Äôm not sure how many of you are familiar with or have heard of the neurotransmitter GABA. I‚Äôd like to share my knowledge with you and briefly explain the basic concepts behind GABA.

I am involved in scientific research, and while writing my Master‚Äôs thesis, I spent a lot of time researching and reading scientific papers on this topic. I will leave links to the papers for anyone who wants to learn more or become interested in this subject.

GABA is an important neurotransmitter in your brain that helps calm your mind, reduce stress, and promote restful sleep. But here‚Äôs something you might not know: your gut health plays a significant role in how well GABA works.

Certain gut bacteria, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, help produce GABA, which can improve both mood and sleep quality. Eating probiotic rich foods like yogurt, kimchi, and kefir can support these bacteria, while too much caffeine, alcohol, or irregular sleep patterns can negatively impact GABA‚Äôs effectiveness.

Your circadian rhythm‚Äîyour body‚Äôs internal clock‚Äîalso impacts GABA. Disruptions like inconsistent sleep schedules or exposure to blue light at night can reduce the production of GABA and interfere with relaxation and sleep.

If you want to optimize GABA, focus on a healthy diet, regular sleep patterns, and reducing stimulants like caffeine. It‚Äôs a practical way to support your mental health and overall wellbeing.

1k6du1l,GutHealth,How Food Connects Depression and Obesity,"We often treat mental and physical health as two separate things, especially when it comes to food. But think about it again. How many times have you found yourself eating just because you were anxious or bored?¬†

For me, the worst was back in college during exam season. I‚Äôd eat five times a day, just sitting and studying, and I‚Äôd gain weight every single time.

There‚Äôs actual research showing a connection between obesity, depression, and anxiety. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt happen to everyone, but it‚Äôs more common than we might think.

People struggling with depression and anxiety are more likely to engage in emotional eating, favoring ultra-processed foods high in sugar and fat. That kind of eating pattern doesn‚Äôt just affect weight. It reinforces low mood, creating a cycle of poor diet, stress, and worsening symptoms ([Dakanalis A. et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10005347/)).

Meanwhile, our gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes living in our digestive tract, is highly sensitive to dietary changes. A diet high in processed foods reduces microbial diversity and promotes inflammation, both of which have been linked to depression and other mental disorders. On the flip side, fiber-rich, plant-forward diets help grow beneficial bacteria that support brain health through the gut-brain axis ([Horn J. et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01922-0)).¬†One of the most promising diets in this context is the Mediterranean diet. Rich in vegetables, fruits, olive oil, legumes, and fish, it's associated with lower rates of depression, obesity, and chronic disease. It not only provides anti-inflammatory benefits but also supports healthy gut function and promotes the intake of key nutrients for mental resilience ([Ventriglio A. et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7536728/)).

Beyond dietary patterns, the specific nutrients we consume also matter. A scoring system developed to rank ""antidepressant foods"" highlights those rich in folate, B12, iron, omega-3s, and zinc, nutrients often lacking in people with depression. Foods like leafy greens, oysters, salmon, and legumes top the list and may help prevent or reduce depressive symptoms ([LaChance L. & Ramsey D. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6147775/)).

1dmslc4,GutHealth,"Extremely disheartened, anxious and depressed from probiotic yogurt","I either got food poisoning somehow from chicken (doubt it) or regrettably was the way too many probiotic yogurts I ate 5 days ago, but I have been feeling extremely sick the last 5ish days; it has been constant anxiety, mild nausea, feeling short-fused, depression, brain fog, fatigue, and incessant thoughts of self-harm. I have zero flu-like symptoms, so was thinking die-off from the probiotics.

I had already been chronically sick for years before this, and never really had any issues with yogurt or kefir normally. The problem is I'm completely out of ideas for remediating the symptoms so I'm becoming increasingly distraught the symptoms are going to be permanent.

Anything I've tried only temporarily puts a hold on the symptoms until they decide to return.

My routine right now (as of today) is Black tea / caffeine pills in the morning, fasting throughout the day, then vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc, including Hiztaeze / NaturoDao before and after low carb meals, then 2 hours after dinner and 2 hours before bed I take Ginger, Artichoke, Iberogast, DGL, Zinc-L-Carnosine to try to flush everything I can out. I tried activated charcoal away from meals the first couple days, and continued to replenish all necessary vitamins, but honestly can't tell if it affected anything for better or worse.

I'm taking lithium orotate for dopamine synthesis. Magnesium, Zinc Abscorbate to help with die-off effects. L-theanine for the anxiety.


**Important**: I used to always get nauseous or mildly dizzy during heavy concentration or upon mental exertion, followed by fatigue and brain fog the next day, then it went away for some time. I feel more sensitive to it now. If anyone has any similar experience or insight please let me know. It doesn't sound like a balance or dizziness problem per se, feels like more of a physiological problem -- maybe ENS or neurotransmitter issues? 

Is insoluble fiber a good idea to improve transit speeds and motility or will it backfire?

The changes I'm making is becoming much more disciplined about fasting and my dietary habits - otherwise I feel completely lost.

I don't know if this is going to pass eventually. I'm seriously thinking of ending it all. My head feels clogged, so don't feel the energy to continue writing, so if anyone has dealt with the same and has insight please help.

I feel extremely depressed/anxious after eating for like anywhere from 30 min to several hours (pretty fast after eating them, I‚Äôd say 30 min after I‚Äôm done eating) and then some hours later I feel perfectly fine again(mentally, fatigue etc still persists).

1kb13zy,GutHealth,The Microbiome‚Äôs Fingerprint in Alzheimer‚Äôs: A New Frontier in Biomarkers,"There‚Äôs growing evidence that the gut microbiome might be more than just a passive bystander in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs. Research now suggests that changes in gut microbial composition may reflect or even precede neurological decline, raising the possibility that the gut could provide early biomarkers for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

One key finding is that Alzheimer‚Äôs patients often present with a state of gut dysbiosis, a disrupted microbial balance in the gut. This includes increased levels of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in protective, anti-inflammatory strains ([Jiang C. et al., 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-161141)). These shifts have been linked to greater systemic inflammation and elevated gut permeability, both of which can influence brain health through the gut-brain axis.

Some of these microbial changes also correlate with heightened levels of inflammatory cytokines and microbial byproducts like LPS and bacterial amyloids. These compounds may cross the intestinal and blood-brain barriers and potentially contribute to neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta accumulation ([Jiang C. et al., 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-161141)).

Functional differences in the microbiome, including altered production of short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, may also indicate early disruption in gut and brain health ([Afzaal M. et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9549250/)). Reduced butyrate-producing bacteria are associated with impaired gut barrier function and poor immune regulation.

Importantly, dietary changes have shown the potential to reshape microbial composition and modulate immune responses. Diets high in fiber and polyphenols can increase beneficial bacteria, reduce inflammation, and may offer neuroprotective effects ([Wastyk H. et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9020749/)).

Altogether, the evidence points to the gut microbiome as a promising and noninvasive source of early biomarkers in Alzheimer‚Äôs, and potentially a target for preventive strategies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1kb13zy/the_microbiomes_fingerprint_in_alzheimers_a_new/,1745966256.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

1jv4m6t,GutHealth,Fixing your gut might be the best thing you‚Äôll ever do for your brain,"Most of us have heard that gut health is important, but research is showing it might actually play a serious role in brain health too. One study found that a specific probiotic supplement taken daily for 16 weeks improved spatial memory in older adults ([Flynn C. et al., 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiomes/articles/10.3389/frmbi.2025.1454909/full)). Spatial memory is the type we use to navigate and understand our environment, and it's known to decline with stress and age.

In that same study, researchers tested the effects of the probiotic in stressed mice. Usually, stress impairs spatial learning, but mice given the probiotic maintained strong memory performance ([Flynn C. et al., 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiomes/articles/10.3389/frmbi.2025.1454909/full)). Even more interesting, the probiotic boosted the benefits of environmental enrichment like exercise and mental stimulation, suggesting it could help enhance the impact of other healthy habits.

Another study looked at prebiotics, which are different from probiotics but also act on the gut. In a 12-week twin trial, older adults who took a prebiotic supplement showed noticeable improvements in associative memory, a cognitive function that often declines early in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease ([Lochlainn M. et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y)). The use of twins in the study helped eliminate genetic and lifestyle differences, making the results more reliable ([Lochlainn M. et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y)).

These results fit into a growing field of research on the gut brain axis, the two-way communication system between the gut and the brain ([Fekete M. et al., 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/6/789)). There‚Äôs mounting evidence that the gut microbiome plays a role in cognition, mood, and even long-term brain health.

In both studies, increases in helpful gut bacteria like Bifidobacterium were linked to better memory.

y8bg0b,GutHealth,Some interesting facts about Mediterranean diet and gut relationship.,"For most of people Mediterranean diet is probably the healthiest diet in the world and it is not a strict meal plan as lots of people might think, instead it is a lifestyle that focuses on enjoying whole food and physical activity.

The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating that follows the traditional eating patterns in the countries surrounding the Mediterranean sea and due to the wide range of health benefits it provides, lots of people are transitioning to it, some of them progressively and no few people diving literally into it.

Fish is the main protein source instead of red meat, poultry or pork and also it emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and olive oil. Besides it includes red wine-in moderation.

 Fermented dairy is consumed regularly. Eggs and poultry are occasionally consumed but red meat are eaten regularly.

In Mediterranean region people indulge in treats like gelato and baklava in moderation.

The Mediterranean diet is associated with lower cholesterol, reduced risk of heart attack and stroke, lower risk of Parkinson¬¥s and Alzheimer¬¥s diseases and a longer life. Emerging research shows it may also reduce risk of, and benefit those with, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.

But a different thing happens when people suffering from digestive system diseases switch to  Mediterranean diet because in most cases they realize quickly that it seems not to offer them the effectiveness they‚Äôre expecting from it and most of the time they don‚Äôt see improvements but symptoms worsening and that make people get confused because they don‚Äôt understand why one the most proven and healthy diet in the world doesn‚Äôt work for them.

The answer to that must be found in something very simple: detox and repairing body‚Äôs processes.

It‚Äôs widely known that if a car is loosing power people need to take it to the vehicle repair shop and the mechanic will clean the systems and/or repair it, if needed; when computers become slow the computer specialist will reboot the system and that‚Äôs it. Same thing with your coffee maker, your blender, your oven and the list goes on.

The key is to understand that as people widely know that the equipment must be cleaned and repaired when it‚Äôs not working properly and previously to avoid any issue, their digestive system must be cleaned and repaired when it‚Äôs not working properly before switching from one diet to another. If we think in the line of cars that would be like replacing the car oil and putting a new oil without cleaning the system previously, everybody knows the outcomes there.

When it comes about gut problems people never think about detox or repair theirs digestive systems before jumping from one diet to another. In fact most of people‚Äôs digestive systems never stop, people are used to put food into it 3, 4, 5, 6 times on daily basis since they wake up, for 365 days a year and that‚Äôs why their digestive system get exhausted due to years and years of overworking and finally fails.

When that occurs people try different drugs, medical treatments, ‚Äúmagic‚Äù supplements, some ‚Äúsuper foods‚Äù, they also switch to Mediterranean diet as a proven healthy diet and some other diets and even do fasting but at the end they don‚Äôt reach the outcome expected because none of those methods foresee cleansing and repairing before rebooting their digestive system, enhancing people‚Äôs pain, suffering and overwhelming because they don‚Äôt see a suitable solution.

To align with healthy eating patterns to take care of the Gut while adhering to Mediterranean diet people must:

   Eliminate from the Mediterranean diet the unfriendly gut food that promote free radicals and inflammation and spoil the gut like:

1.	Added-sugars, added-sugar goods and sugar alcohols: they produce lots of Advanced Glycation End Products(AGEs) and also promote pancreas and liver overwork.

2.	Dairy products: milk and milk-based products. Humans are the only mammals who keep drinking milk after they are weaned, but the worst is that the milk comes from spices far away different from human race.

3.	Gluten: it is the protein of wheat and human digestive system can not metabolize it, causing a wide range of severe reactions from the immunological system which its most extreme manifestation is widely known as celiac condition.

4.	Coffee: dark-roasted coffee is a high source of free radicals due to the process it goes through and sugar added.

5.	Alcohol: alcohol including wine disrupts sleep patterns and interferes with the effectiveness of medication and supplements. Also alcohol alters the liver function and promote liver overwork.

6.	Processed, highly processed or ultra processed food: it is a huge source of AGEs.

7.	Vegetable oils except: olive oil, linseed oil, coconut oil and avocado oil.

Besides, people also must:

Adhere to Healthy cooking methods: The way people cook their food need to be considered too, because grilling, broiling, roasting, searing and frying, in particular, propagate and accelerate new AGEs formation.

Increase the food sources of DPA, DHA and EPA to reduce inflammation and enhance brain-gut connection.

Increase the intake of eggs: eggs are very rich in cholesterol and also active organic compounds like lutein and zeaxanthin that help repairing cells.

Increase the intake of Vegetables including starches, fruits, whole grains, beans, peas, and lentils, unsalted nuts and seeds, and lean meats and poultry to benefit from fiber intake to promote intestinal motility.

Use natural spices for food preparations like turmeric, black pepper, clove, Rosemary and ginger among others to activate people‚Äôs own natural anti inflammatory system.

Cut down the food intakes to 3 meals or less on daily basis: reducing the meals to 3 or 2 meals a day, will immediately reduce the insulin resistance of the body cells, resulting in weight loss, no risk of diabetes and no gut overwork.

Adhere to other life style patterns such as:

Quit inactivity: Regular physical activity is one of the most important things people can do to improve their health. Moving more and sitting less have tremendous benefits for everyone, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or current fitness level.

Create, develop and foment excellent sleep patterns with the healthiest version of the Mediterranean diet: getting the right amount of sleep is integral to good health. As persons sleep the body repairs itself, helping the body and brain function optimally. 

Summing up, Mediterranean diet is famous because it helps people to avoid heart diseases and to reduce the risk of suffering heart attacks, also it‚Äôs really effective to avoid brain diseases too but it could be much more effective for the digestive system if people make the adjustments described above.
In conclusion focusing on body‚Äôs natural cleansing and repairing processes even when there are no issues prescribed yet will guarantee people to heal from diseases and keep healthy all their life span. 

Nature is wise and has provided our body with a powerful detox and repairing natural system. Let‚Äôs give space to our body and provide it with the nutrients it needs to strive and accomplish it‚Äôs mission and we will start enjoying the benefits very soon: longer and healthier life.

Mediterranean diet with some adjustments is healthier and more powerful to take care of your digestive system, relief symptoms and stay healthy, so stop hesitating, act proactively and engage now, your body will appreciate it.

1gk1cln,GutHealth,B12 removed my food intolerances,"I wanted to let others know about it because it was a very nice surprise. I had food intolerances likely since 15 years, first identified 6 years ago when I went on an elimination diet. I would get muscular pain and many other symptoms from consuming gluten, soy, cabagge, pineapple, peapods, etc. So I stayed away from all of them for years. Last time I had a bad reaction was a year ago when I ate yellow peapods, which I tried since I saw I tolerate the green ones. So I am certain my issues didn't heal over the years in which I excluded those foods.
Fast forward I started to feel really bad in spring. I got neurological problems like short term memory loss, dropping things out of my hands. My blood result was slightly off, not enough that any doctor would take it seriously, but I tried to understand why were my blood cells larger and fewer and I came to the b12/folate deficiency anemia. Now I eat meat but since I always had gut issues I thought maybe I don't absord b12. I then tested myself but didn't wait for the result and bought sublingual b12 and right away after taking it my symptoms improved, but what was unexpected and very nice was that my guts improved. I had soft stools and itching likely because of it, and this went away. Later it came back but more sporadically than before. However, my biggest surprise was when in the city, frustrated that the salad I ordered was full or cabagge, I decided to eat it along with the bread served with it and drown my pain in alcohol later, but the pain never came. This is why I am 100% sure b12 fixed it for me.
Now, taking too much (3mg) of B12 started to give me headaches and light sensitivity so I saw I didn't need too much. Based on the blood result I didn't need any since my value was 400, I don't recall the units but it was within the normal range but my folate being close to the lower end could indicate folate worked hard to make red blood cells and make up for the b12 deficiency. B12 like magnesium is unreliably measured from blood but I didn't want to invest money in the more accurate tests since taking b12 simply worked. Nowdays I still take b12 every other day.
Meantime I also discovered I am vitamin D deficient, and by measuring my values after a lot of sun exposure I saw that I don't absorb it properly from sun and I was still deficient. I ended up taking large values, not 2000 daily but rather 5000-10,000, and after a month and a bit my value is finally from 18ng to 54ng. Since vitamin D is very important for immunity I thought I could share this info as well. That it is very important to test and see if you need sun or supplements. My sense of physical well being increased and my energy is better as well. I had bone pain so that is healing now. I take magnesium and K2 with it because I got insomnia initially, likely due to magnesium deficiency.

jjcmzc,HealthAnxiety,Stressed About Colon Cancer/IBD,"I‚Äôve (25F) struggled with anxiety since I was 2. Literally. When I was 2, I wouldn‚Äôt poop, and I was diagnosed with anxiety-induced constipation. Things haven‚Äôt really gotten better since then (LOL).

I‚Äôm now 25, and a year or two ago I suspected I was lactose intolerant. I varied between diarrhea and constipation, almost never having a regular movement. Once I started cutting dairy, I felt better. When I had dairy, I‚Äôd need to poop almost immediately. So my bowel movements have literally never been normal. ANYWAY-

Back in the summer I went to the ER for upper right quadrant pain. ER doc was sure it was gallstones but the ultrasound showed it wasn‚Äôt. Chest X-ray was clear too. EKG was 100% perfect. They ordered an MRI with contrast of my liver, because the ultrasound showed what might be some fattyness. I got the MRI, and everything looked normal except for some mild fattyness of the liver (as expected). 

Now- this is important because in my spiraling, I‚Äôve been trying to convince myself that if there was something wrong with me they would have seen it on the ultrasound or MRI. 

Last week I wiped after a bowel movement. It was kind of a hard one to get out, but it wasn‚Äôt super painful or anything. But when I wiped, there was blood on the toilet paper. No blood in the stool or bowl that I could see, but def on the toilet paper. I kept wiping and there kept being more blood. Fresh and bright red. This, of course, sent me on a Google spiral and I was 100% sure I had colon cancer. I frantically checked my movements after that, but it didn‚Äôt happen again. Everything was normal. 

Now today. I go to poop, and it‚Äôs sort of hard to come out again but even less so than the previous incident described above. Nothing I would consider might make me bleed at all. This time, there was blood mixed in with the stool on the toilet paper as I wiped + two small bright spots of blood in the stool itself. 

I‚Äôm freaked out all over again. I‚Äôm terrified of doctors and I don‚Äôt want to get a colonoscopy even though it would probably put my fears to rest. I know it‚Äôs likely hemorrhoids or a fissure but my mind is bouncing around and sure I‚Äôve got colon cancer or IBD that‚Äôll lead to cancer.

l8t3es,HealthAnxiety,27/M Colonoscopy and fear of colon cancer,"I‚Äôm scared. Like really scared.

I‚Äôm scheduled for a colonoscopy on Wednesday, and every second is mentally agonizing. 

I started experiencing recital bleeding frequently two years ago while in the throes of alcoholism. I got sober for the most part after a few stops in the old hooch house, and it mostly cleared up, only manifesting occasionally. When I gave it any mind at all, I would chalk it up to hemorrhoids. The truth is, I didn‚Äôt really care what was causing it. I was alone, trying to maintain sobriety (failing on occasion) and perfectly content with making the bare minimum amount of money and playing video games/hanging out with my dog until a bad bender or some other thing killed me.

I‚Äôve been sober for well over a year now, but I still experience it on and off - maybe once a month. I met the most wonderful woman in the world, got a fantastic job, and we‚Äôre looking at buying a house. I‚Äôm so happy... and now I‚Äôm so worried that I sold myself short. I gave up on the idea of happiness, but I‚Äôve found it, and I‚Äôm horrified of what this colonoscopy will say. I have no familial history of colon cancer, I lift weights, a lot, run 3-6 miles regularly and maintain a pretty healthy diet. Despite being blessed with two parents who work as nurses, assuring me it‚Äôs hemorrhoids, I can‚Äôt shake the nagging feeling that it‚Äôs so much worse. I‚Äôm afraid of losing everything because of my former general apathy toward life.

I‚Äôm just tired of the tears. I‚Äôm tired of the anxiety. I‚Äôm tired of the stress. I‚Äôll have concrete answers in a few days, but the relief that brings is shut out by the damning feeling that I‚Äôm staring at the end. 

I don‚Äôt know what I expect to get out of this post, but I have advice for those who may be in a relatively similar boat.. get checked. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself or let fear/anything else stop you. You‚Äôre worth it. Just do it sooner rather than later.

A month ago I had severe diarrhea for like 4 days with bad stomach pain, then it went away. But I've been nervous ever since, especially because I still have some weird digestive issues from time to time, but nothing as bad as what happened a month ago. Are there any key symptoms to differentiate the two?",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/kzx045/crohns_disease/,1610984465.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
i6p5hr,HealthAnxiety,How do you get back to a normal state after months of convincing yourself you have a disease (Crohns)?,"I've been fully (and I mean fully - like mentally preparing myself for surgery, figuring out where to buy medication, etc) convinced for the last 10 months that I had Crohns. My symptoms were very mild in comparison to what I'd seen online, nor were they particularly typical of the disease, but I was still worried due to a great aunt having it.

Well, lo and behold, after countless blood and stool tests showing absolutely no inflammation, malnourishment, infection, or anything else wrong with me that could be from IBD, both my PCP and a GI doc have told me that it's not IBD and that there'd be no point getting further testing like a colonoscopy. My PCP has me doing a food diary, as she thinks it's very likely just a food intolerance/IBS. Lactose intolerance is also very common and likely since I'm Jewish.

I feel a lot better, but my anxiety wants to find something to worry about and doesn't want to accept that it's something benign. I found myself researching colorectal cancer again last night and contemplating whether that could be the problem. Since I never got the colonoscopy, I was also worrying that that could show inflammation that somehow evaded detection on all my other tests.

The worst part is that anxiety makes IBS worse, so if it is that I'm just making things worse for myself. Logically, I know that there's a very high chance I need to make dietary changes and that I should trust my doctor. I've been so stressed for so long that it feels impossible to move on from this, though.

How do you move on after getting the all clear from the doctors? How do you avoid questioning their judgement if they didn't do every possible test?",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/i6p5hr/how_do_you_get_back_to_a_normal_state_after/,1597000397.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

My stomach doesn‚Äôt hurt. But it feels... unsettled? Especially on the lower/left side. I have lost my appetite these past few days.  

Whenever I put food near my mouth, my hand starts to shake and I feel like puking. It all started when I drank a Nutrament (a dairy based sports drink). 

I should also mention I have been INSANELY tired and lethargic. I can barely walk more than a block without feeling absolutely exhausted. Even the thought of walking tires me.

3yo8mw,HealthAnxiety,"Crohn's, Cancer, or nothing at all","Hi, everyone.

I'm a high schooler who has had trouble with panic and hypochondria for years. I always find myself reading into every detail of my symptoms,
and always thinking the worst. Not a unique story here, but it's mine.

About a month or more ago, I started finding blood in my stools and on the toilet paper. After the third incident, I told my parents and
went to the GP, who found an anal fissure and sent me on my way. I figured that was that.

However, recently I've experienced slight abdominal pain (especially when I eat fatty foods, and worsening when I suck in my stomach),
as well as a general decrease in appetite. This has led to gradual weight loss amounting to about 6-7 pounds since I started keeping track. Both of my siblings have been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease, but they were both seriously ill (vomiting, diarrhea) when they went to be diagnosed. Neither had blood in the stool of any kind.

I'm not necessarily asking for reassurement so much as guidance. Should I bring the matter up again with my parents? I don't want to make a 
serious mistake that could cost me years off my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/3yo8mw/crohns_cancer_or_nothing_at_all/,1451408819.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

I don't know how much of it is in my head and how much of it is real. I felt a weird dent in my head yesterday and now I'm freaking out about bone cancer. When I observe my skin I swear I see red patches everywhere, the inside of my mouth doesn't look normal, my ADHD is misdiagnosed and is actually a brain tumor, my weightloss is probably linked to something terrible as well. I want to go to every kind of doctor there is, get everything checked but I can't and won't. There's always something wrong with me. I would have to get everything checked every day and I doubt I would feel healthy even then. I never feel healthy and live in constant fear that I'm going to die because I'm actually terribly sick but don't know it. I can't go a single day without thinking about how I unknowingly have leukemia or Crohn's or Parkinson's disease. Or an STD even though I'm a virgin, because it can happen outside of sex sometimes. I try so hard to convince myself I'm okay but I can't. All I do is try to numb my brain with YouTube videos because the second I stop I start thinking. And then I can't stop thinking. I'm so sick of living like this. I can't stop and I am terrified to go to a doctor. I've had a slight pain in my throat so now I've started suspecting I have COVID-19. And if I have COVID-19 even if I recover I might end up disabled and I don't know what to do.

eg546b,HealthAnxiety,I'm scared of my stomach,"I was born with stomach problems, pooped every couple days since I came out of the womb. My mom has IBS so that might be what I have.
It sucked growing up, got worse in the winter, then better when the sun was out. It just got worse and worse and worse. I started having burning pain in my feet up to my knees, the entire area bright red accompanied by joint pain. No doctor knew what it was, the last guy told me it was growing pains and normal but every person I every nonchalantly told me ""I've never had that"" or something on that level.
My feet got worse, my hands started getting bad, and my stomach just was steadily becoming the worst thing possible.
It's to the extent I can't feel temperature in my feet or hands anymore, if you tap my foot without me looking, my entire foot will hurt because I can't feel where you hit. I can't eat gluten, high fiber foods, and dairy without getting massively sick. I get canker sores once a month and they usually scar in my mouth. I learned I'm allergic to a good chunk of perfume which make my eyes extremely dry.
I bleed most of the time when I go now. I get really bad stomach episodes at least once a month, sometimes once a week, and I don't know why. It keeps me up until 3 am with diarrhea and puking, never due to stress or any solid reason why. I think I've had an ulcer or two before, mostly because the pain was extreme and I haven't had heart burn since those two times, I get anal fissures frequently too. I've had chronic stomach pain for the past 3 years, never any relief and it's worse in the mornings. I don't know why it happens. My tongue has red and white patches in it, bite marks (I bite my tongue while eating almost 24/7), and sometimes burns at the left and right sides. My joint pain is so severe that even staying perfectly still feels like I have 30 needles piercing the joint.
I don't know what's going on and I'm really anxious because sometimes I bleed purple and I don't know if that's because the blood is faint or because it's intestinal bleeding. I don't know what's going on, but I'm just so scared that it could be cancer or a mix between IBS and Crohn's which can lead to cancer.
I'm just afraid.

I have IBS, so I‚Äôm used to digestive discomfort/unpredictability in my day to day life. The problem is, I can‚Äôt stop worrying that my IBS is actually a more serious issue, or that it will turn into one. I believe that knowledge is power, so I decided to start reading a book written by a woman around my age who was diagnosed with Crohn‚Äôs Disease. BIG MISTAKE.

I thought that reading about her experiences would teach more me about the differences between IBS and a more serious digestive disease, but all it did was trigger my fear of one day developing Crohn‚Äôs. It sounds absolutely hellish, and I feel like my life is stunted as it is because of IBS. I know now how stupid it was for me to read some of that book, and I won‚Äôt be reading any more of it.

I thought my epilepsy was due to the cerebral palsy which is a common thing but apparently mine is genetic although no one else in my family has it (and I have many siblings.) my first doctor said it was idiopathic though which is a little more comforting. I was diagnosed at 16.

Ulcerative colitis started happening in 2010 aged 14. I had been having blood in my stool ever since I was a small kid but we weren't concerned and just thought it was from straining.

I've had CP all my life, obviously. Anyway, my epilepsy was controlled for 3 and a half, almost 4 years until two months ago. I ran out of meds for 3 days, had my first seizure. Got back on them and was CRAZY paranoid about having another one but I calmed down eventually. Had another seizure. Obviously I'm freaking out like crazy now. 

My dosage has been increased by a really good doctor and I'm feeling better now but ever since having the first seizure I have been very anxious whereas I used to be carefree and happy before it, i used to be a MAJOR hypochondriac but I've not worried about my health significantly/to a memorable extent in a long time. 2 days ago I saw something that triggered me into a spiral of fears about old age and death, and I haven't been sleeping.

iba5vj,HealthAnxiety,Extremely terrified right now. I'm curretly experiencing almost all the symptoms of colon cancer.,"I'm so scared and anxious right now I can barely even function. My symptoms started 3 months ago when I ate some take out food one night. A few hours after eating, I suddenly felt stomach cramps and bloating, followed by nonstop diarrhea the day after. After that it changed to bad constipation that becomes worse as the days go by. I started having what looked like normal constipation with alternating watery stools. But 2 nights ago I forced myself to poop but what came out was short literally pencil thin stools. That is what terrified my the most because every search you make on the internet regarding thin stools always point to cancer. 

My symptoms have been going on for 3 months now with no signs of subsiding. In fact it feels like it's getting worse every day. The only hallmark colon cancer symptom I haven't experienced yet is probably blood in my stool. I've talked to some people with Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis and some of them told me that they had the exact same symptoms before getting diagnosed and it eased me a little. My grandpa also told me a story of him having a bad case of stomach pains and bleeding diarrhea back in his working days which sounded a lot like IBD, but he never got any official diagnosis because he had never undergone colonoscopy so he just kind of lived with it. I thought maybe my disease actually is IBD that I got from heredity after hearing that. But I'm still very scared because these symptoms feel much closer to colon cancer than IBD. 

I just want to hear everyone's opinion about this. I'm literally losing sleep over this for a few days now. Seeing the thin stools really freaked the hell out of me and I've never been able to calm down since. I'm already scheduled to visit the GI tomorrow and I want to get a diagnosis so bad right now to give me some piece of mind.

5lpcv8,HealthAnxiety,So I have an ulcer but...no h. pylori?,"If you've ever had an ulcer, you know that almost 90 percent are caused by the bacteria h. pylori OR antiinflammatory drugs.

However, I have my first ulcer and have neither of these.....Never used ibuprofen or anything like that extendedly. They even tested me today for h. pylori with my blood and it came back negative. 

So of course im freaking out. The doctor said that stress could cause one (and let me tell you, I have stressed so much in the last 3 months) but...I've read online that isn't true? So now I can't help but assume that it's stomach cancer, even though my doctor said I have less than one percent of a chance of having it.....

I also have chronic diarrhea and a fever that comes and goes for weeks on end. (Went up to 99.5 today when I started to really feel my ulcer after I ate) so my doctor said it could also be crohns disease, which im fine with honestly. I'd take that over stomach cancer! 

So....have you ever heard of this? Having an ulcer without h pylori and nsaid drugs? I don't know what to think. Im so young and healthy (22) and this came out of nowhere! I do think it could be crohns but I also feel like it might be stomach cancer...? The pain is pretty severe and makes me feel super nauseous even though I have yet to throw up. I more feel nauseous and feel the need to use the bathroom than to throw up. 

My doctor today also said it could be that the acid in my stomach is draining into my intestines and that's whats causing my chronic diarrhea. Do you think that's true? He said 60 percent sure it's the ulcer and 40 percent sure it's crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. 

Please help me feel better about this. I used to post on anxietyzone but it's been removed for some reason ): I just keep assuming the worst.

HOWEVER, headaches, muscle weakness in right arm, fatigue, pain in right ribcage and weird vision still are with me.

So i go to an eye doctor and they say my eye pressure is good and my veins by my optic nerve look good but my right optic nerve is larger.

also not normal almost ever. Also get diagnosed as farsighted. 

Call him and he says its all related to vision and still no chance of brain problem. 

Am i over reacting or should I see a new doctor for a second opinion?

I feel like headaches, muscle weakness in right arm, fatigue, pain in right ribcage and weird vision, plus trouble concentrating for long, along with beaus lines and an enlarged optic nerve, calls for an MRI to atleast rule out brain tumor or anything else.

bimyyl,HealthAnxiety,For people with heart health anxiety,"[Link to previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/asee8b/tips_for_heart_palpitations/)

*IM NOT A DOCTOR, so only read further IF YOU'VE BEEN CHECKED OUT BY YOUR DOCTOR AND TOLD YOU'RE HEALTHY*

I wrote a post with tips for Heart Health Anxiety a while back; I've been struggling with some health anxiety in the past few days and I wanted to put some of the things that help me calm down in here; 

&#x200B;

1. A heart can either be **healthy** or **sick**. There's no **in-between** option. 

A healthy heart is one that's been checked by doctors, in some cases, multiple times and by multiple doctors and they've all agreed that there's nothing wrong with it. The heart is obviously a vital organ so if there was something seriously wrong it would show **symptoms**. But get this : It would show symptoms ***CONSTANTLY***;  

It wouldn't be like ""Oh, let me hurt a bit, then calm down for the rest of the day and tomorrow I'll get a few palpitations and then be fine for a few weeks and then act up again""; Uh uh. That is how a ***HEALTHY*** heart acts when being confronted with other things such as: ***stress, anxiety, food consumption, alcohol, sleep (or lack of it), smoking, hard exercise, hormones;*** 

A sick heart would **let you know**. There would be symptoms that **don't go away**. A swelling in legs that lasts weeks, pain that never stops, breathing issues that get worst through months etc; And for all of you that have been checked by doctors and told all clear - a sick heart would show up on **every, no matter how basic, of a test**  doctors do. It would show up in blood works, it would show up in EKG, it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all the damn time, every time you go and ask for a check up. The symptoms of a sick heart ***do not hide.*** They make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap; 

&#x200B;

2.   A sudden heart attack/cardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances:

&#x200B;

\- Your heart is sick/born with a defect from birth; These types of sudden heart attacks/arrest are often if not always the result of someone not having symptoms and ***NOT CHECKING*** their heart fully; They're usually quite young people who's never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just **assume** that theres nothing wrong with them. I have a friend, 22F, with no symptoms that went for a day-to-date easy check up and the doctor heard a murmur in her heart **straight away** and now she knows what to do and what not to do; If your doctor has checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that - **healthy with no birth defect;**

&#x200B;

\- You've lived usually 40+ years of unhealthy lifestyle and you're probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol, arteries build up etc, things that doctors, ***AGAIN***, would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your lifestyle for the better if you don't want to suffer a heart attack. 

&#x200B;

\- An accident, like getting electrocuted; 

&#x200B;

**A healthy heart does not just GIVE UP without outside force making it do so.** 

That outside force can also be food, stress, sedentary lifestyle, but these are all things you can help yourself with; If it's something you can't help, like lets say hormones during period/pregnancies  (like it was for me) or work related stress, all you can do is wait it out and believe it will come to an end; ***It always does;*** 

   

&#x200B;

3.  People who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own heart symptoms; I know that I do. I'm not much of a perfectionist myself, but I can focus very strongly on things that I deem important; If there's a problem I'll focus on it until I've made it go away. However, example, focusing on a heart palpitations I've got only makes me more stressed which in result brings **even more palpitations** and the circle begins; Realising that you're good at focusing can help you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on it, examine it from all sides, think of all possible outcomes and completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even more anxiety and even more symptoms; 

&#x200B;

Its nearly impossible to **STOP** focusing on something that scares you; So the alternative is, instead of stopping the focus, to **shift it to LOGIC**. Shift it to past experiences when you've had this symptom and it's gone away on its own; Shift to doctors telling you you're fine. Shift to ""I just had a lot of chocolate today"", ""its hormones"", ""Its just stress""; And no, this is **not ignoring the problem**. Believe me, I've been there and I'd tell myself ""what are you doing!!! How can you try to calm yourself that its just stress?? What if this time its not??? What if this time you're really really dying???!!?""... and well, the simple ""**what if THIS TIME**"" in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well, I'm still here; 

&#x200B;

I hope this helps you a bit; Remember, you can always get checked by a doctor, even if its your 100th time, if that brings you peace, there's no shame in that; I hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful day! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/bimyyl/for_people_with_heart_health_anxiety/,1556525312.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1e37gv3,HealthAnxiety,"PSA: If you're on this sub, there's a good chance your health anxiety is actually a form of OCD. ","I post this every now and then because I was in a very dark hole with my health anxiety. I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences. I could barely function, and was desperate for help.



I noticed that any normal ""anxiety""-based therapies did not help my health anxiety. If anything, they worsened it. Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc. It made my anxiety far worse. I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O.  Turns out, that's what I have!

Basically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental. For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to ""cleanse"" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance. Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time? That's OCD. That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands. They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok, or you *need* to just find that one article that will tell you exactly what you want to hear and alleviate your fears.

Luckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve. You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts. Don't create secondary thoughts from them. Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance. Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere. Don't even try to force the thought out. Any type of ""interaction"" with the thought isn't going to help. Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave.  This is the basis of ERP which is the gold standard for OCD treatment.  It's very difficult to do on your own, so I recommend finding a specialist if you can.  However, I did a ton of work on my own that was immensely helpful, so it's possible.

It feels difficult at first, but over time you'll have a ton of practice. I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.



You're going to be ok :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1e37gv3/psa_if_youre_on_this_sub_theres_a_good_chance/,1720977037.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
98fj85,HealthAnxiety,My health anxiety has gone and so can yours. It‚Äôs a state of mind!,"Hey listen,

I have been where you have been, I‚Äôm 27 years old and in the past year I‚Äôve had the following ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù :

- twitching all over my body
- numb arms in the morning
- such blurry vision I couldn‚Äôt read the computer
- dizziness (I constantly felt drunk)
- Yellow shits with bits in (purely from worry and anxiety, anxiety makes your digestion super fast)
- stomach ache
- Spasming stomach
- bloating which was so uncomfortable
- constant acid reflux
- a white covered tongue 
- inability to think, unable to concentrate completely zoned out like a zombie
- heart jumps and scares
- Bloodshot eyes
- chest tightness and pain
- headaches
- migraines with aura
- ear ache
- ringing in my ear
- crawling sensation in my ear
- ulcers like all the time
- felt weak (e.g. In the gym)
- Nausea
- Back pain
- Joint pain
- jittery jaw/ involuntary jaw moving
- swollen lymph nodes
- numbness and tingling down one side of face 


As a result of this I had the following tests:

- 1 MRI
- About 30 blood tests (diabetes, thyroid, full blood count you name it, I‚Äôve had it)
- About 5 stool tests
- 1 ECG
- 2 ‚Äúemergency‚Äù hospital rushes
- 1 x-Ray
- Ears checked multiple times
- Saw an ENT specialist twice
- Saw a neurology specialist
- Had an oral cancer screening (have a single tonsil up)
- Had a mole checked
- got a lump in my tongue checked
(Definitely had more than this too)

Paid privately for screenings and all sorts (I‚Äôm from the UK so healthcare is free)


I‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôve had the following illnesses at times:

- MS
- Lymes disease
- Skin cancer
- Oral cancer
- Bowel Cancer
- A Stroke
- Brain tumor
- Heart attack
Etc etc....

Guess how many things I had wrong with me?

##**ZERO!**

I was worried about a few things, one was a lump in my tongue which the doctor said was fine, and now I‚Äôve learnt to accept that they are right.

I‚Äôm still here, I still have the lump, everything is okay and it‚Äôs the same for you.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The best things you can do to help yourself are:

###**1) DO NOT FUCKING GOOGLE EVER**

I stopped googling about 2 months ago, been 100x better ever since.

Has google ever helped you identify a killer disease? Nope didn‚Äôt think so.


###**2) TRY TO BE RATIONAL**

The best thing you can do if you think something is wrong is tell yourself:

‚Äúokay I have found this, what is the most likely cause‚Äù
(the most likely thing is that it is something benign) 

‚Äúokay then I will wait for 2 weeks and then go to the doctor‚Äù

9.9 times out of 10 it will be gone


###**3) REALISE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF - IGNORE YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS**

Are you going to honestly let your own brain control how you feel for the rest of your life? Take the time to take control now. It‚Äôs honestly completely in your control.

Take a moment and consider what you are doing, there are two people in your head, your conscious self (if you choose to think something) and your unconscious self, which is there doing its own thing.

The unconscious self will make you think things are wrong with you, but you need to take control and not let it control you. As soon as you let yourself think you have something your body will feel as if you have it.

It sounds dumb as fuck, but you need to choose to be healthy, choose that you are okay. Because by choosing that you‚Äôre not okay.... shock you‚Äôre not okay!

Every single one was manifested by myself cos I allowed myself to get so worked up and stressed.


###**4) LOOK AFTER YOURSELF**

Sleep, exercise etc will help. I had a vitamin D deficiency which was definitely contributing to my anxiety, get a test for that if you don‚Äôt get much sun, almost everyone is deficient in it.

Heck take a low dose regardless the placebo effect might help!


###**5) THINK ABOUT THE PAST**

How many times have we been though this? How many times have you had a deadly infections disease?

Are you dead?

No. Why? Because the average life expectancy is like 80 years old....

###**6) BELIEVE YOUR DOCTOR**

How many times have you seen a doctor? How many times were they right? 

‚ÄúBut they only looked for one second they must be doing a bad job‚Äù - no they‚Äôve just seen whatever you‚Äôre showing them 39728364 times before they know what good looks like. If they were worried they would look for longer.

These people are medical professionals because they love people, including you.


###**7) THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE**

Would you rather spend the rest of your life, no matter how long or short it may be like this?

You‚Äôve got shit to go and be successful at, and you sure as hell will struggle if you let something consume you like anxiety will.

It‚Äôs no good being alive but not living, go and live!


###**8) DON‚ÄôT FUCKING GOOGLE**

Just incase you didn‚Äôt read the first time.

###**9) TALK TO PEOPLE**

More people have anxiety than you think, almost everyone above like 25 has been anxious or depressed.

Therapy is good, get it if you can, but ultimately it‚Äôs up to you to take control and ‚Äòmake yourself healthy‚Äô

###**10)  STOP CHECKING STUFF**

Poking, prodding, opening, touching all makes things dirty, swollen, irritated. Whatever is ‚Äúwrong with you‚Äù will not go away if you keep fucking touching it.

Apply a rule to yourself like ‚ÄúI will leave it alone for 2 weeks and then go to the doctors‚Äù that will help you to filter things that do and don‚Äôt matter more easily.

Finally:


*Oh and I am not a medical professional and nothing I‚Äôve written is medical advice. You should listen to what your doctor tells you*.... which I am guessing is that you have anxiety, which is why you‚Äôre on here searching for answers. You won‚Äôt find them here, nor will you find anything wrong with you!

Go and enjoy your life, go socialise, make a stand, like I said I don‚Äôt have anxiety anymore, I stopped one day and said fuck this, I‚Äôm choosing to not have this anymore and it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs a state of mind and you can control your own brain IF TOU CHOOSE TOO!

If you want anything or someone to talk too message me. I‚Äôve not been anxious for at least 2 months now.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


**Edit:It's now been 6 months since I posted this, I consider my HA to be gone now, I default to the 'normal' rational thought process that everyone else uses. Honestly stop googling and start living.**


3 year update.

Wow where did that time go?

Life has never been better. I don‚Äôt panic about my health, I don‚Äôt obsess or check things, I don‚Äôt google, I accept I will one day die, I don‚Äôt stress about it because what will be will be, I accept that of the 100s of times I have worried in the past so far 0 of them have been a cause for concern, I no longer stress myself out about my health.

I live. It‚Äôs that simple.

Good luck everyone, you can take control and move on with your life, it really is in your hands, no one will do it for you.

1hpqyxp,HealthAnxiety,AI is the single best thing for health anxiety,"Hear me out. I have always had awful health anxiety where I get pulled into the internet spiral of doom. AI has helped me so much with this. I use ChatGPT 4o, so I‚Äôm not sure about the simpler models, but basically for any worry, I outline the concern, I explain I‚Äôm concerned, and then I ask for odds on what the cause is. 

I could be wrong, but I assume other worriers are also fairly analytical and are helped by seeing odds repeatedly for reassurance.  

With AI, you can get the answers you need to those ridiculous questions only we think about. For example, I recently learned that I‚Äôd used non food grade tubing on a reverse osmosis system.  It was only a couple of feet, but I began to freak out about chemicals. Using AI, I was able to do ridiculously tedious things like determine the possible chemicals, the risks, the actual water amount that might have sat in the tube (.3 ounces), and learned probably far too much about how tube classifications work. Now obviously, this is overkill for most people, but for health worriers, it‚Äôs awesome to have a calm and knowledgeable tool that can answer any ridiculous question, while not pointing to stupid Google sites - I.e healthline.

It can do so much physically

That all I can remember for now if I can think of anymore I‚Äôll let you know. Remember that anxiety can pretty much do anything to the body and it is very aggravating and can make you feel like you have a serious condition. If you guys have anymore symptoms comment them bellow. Remember and try to stick with the facts that some diseases we are afraid of are very rare and try to avoid the what if.

Do not google anything you experience it pops up with the worst. Just googling muscle weakness is mind destroying and scary and they always put the worst first. If you guys ever feel alone or scared you can dm me I am happy to help.

Edit: thanks to someone in the comments the pointed out a mistake I made.

You can also get coldness it your fingers and toes.

You can also grind your teeth in your sleep causing tmj but that is easily treatable and in most cases fix themselves 

Also can make you have nightmares and dream a lot more even if the dreams don‚Äôt make sense and are random.

It also can cause night sweats

It increases the acid production in stomach which causes indigestion, heartburn, stomach uncomfortness.

It impacts on the balance of good and bad bacteria in gut.

It causes stomach gas even if you eat the right food.

It inputs alot in existing problem like IBS.

Also you can feel your heartbeat in the ears and feel it anywhere on the body.

Edit: These are symptoms of anxiety not a diagnosis but if your going through a troubling time and have been under a lot of stress and anxiety then these can relate but if they come out of no where not scared at all. Setup a visit with your gp and still there might be nothing wrong. It is ok to not feel good sometimes doesn‚Äôt mean you are dying of a terrible illness.

Also don‚Äôt be afraid to ask a gp even while you are stress. They will help a lot and if they don‚Äôt they aren‚Äôt a good gp,",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/i35htt/so_im_gonna_make_a_whole_list_of_what_health/,1596488431.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

xrumhm,HealthAnxiety,I‚Äôve been having panic attacks everyday for 2 years. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned.,"For the past two or so years I‚Äôve been convinced I‚Äôm dying of a certain disease. Colon cancer, leukemia, heart disease, you name it. It‚Äôs been bad, and I‚Äôm trying very hard to fix myself, but its hard to convince yourself you‚Äôre fine when you feel these symptoms. Anyways, heres a couple things I‚Äôve learned and hope I can one day use to help myself.

1.) Your symptoms can almost always be traced back to your lifestyle - I realized this today actually. Not getting enough sleep, eating unhealthy, or just isolating yourself & getting in your own mind can lead to worse panic attacks. Recently I‚Äôve found myself staying up way too late, and its led to stronger symptoms.

2.) You can talk yourself out of a panic attack - This one came as a tbit of a surprise because a telltale sign of a panic attack is the overload worrying thoughts flooding your brain, but if you convince yourself you‚Äôre okay and not dying, the panic attack will subside much faster

3.) You will not pass out - Your heart beating fast means you‚Äôre pumping blood throughout your body, including your head. If you feel like you‚Äôre going to pass out, feel your heart rate. If it‚Äôs beating fast, you aren‚Äôt going to pass out. It is possible to pass out from a panic attack, but it‚Äôs very unlikely and not fatal. If you need to take a seat then do it, but know its unlikely you‚Äôre going to pass

4.) Stress and Anxiety can make you feel lethargic for the day - Sometimes when I have panic attacks, or I have a particularly stressful day, I feel extremely lethargic & out of breath for days afterwards. I know a sign of cancer is getting winded quickly, but if this isnt a constant symptom (everyday for weeks) then it‚Äôs probably anxiety

5.) Unless you‚Äôre losing weight rapidly or in terrible pain, it‚Äôs likely you don‚Äôt have cancer - Self explanatory. Getting screened won‚Äôt hurt,  but it‚Äôs not something to worry about usually

6.) ‚ÄúWhat you eat now won‚Äôt affect your heart for 30 years, its incredibly unlikely you‚Äôre having a heart attack unless you‚Äôve been smoking crack every day for 5 years‚Äù - This was told to me by a paramedic during my first panic attack

7.) Its okay to be honest with your friends and family - I know for me personally, I was super self conscious of my breathing and tried to hide my anxiety from my family. If anything, it made it worse. Theres no shame in excusing yourself from a room or telling your people that you‚Äôre currently having a panic attack. They‚Äôll understand.

I should say- I‚Äôm not a doctor. But you really should trust yours. The reason why you hear about ‚ÄúDoctors getting it wrong‚Äù in the news so often is because it happens so rarely that journalists deem it newsworthy. If they made an article for everytime a doctor was right, it‚Äôd overload the news. Take a breath, relax, chances are you‚Äôre perfectly fine. If you must get a screening, do so, but try your best to trust the results. If you‚Äôre young, chances are you don‚Äôt have heart problems. Unless you‚Äôve smoked crack 5 times a day for 7 years

Use this megathread for vents, rants, worries, fixations, DAEs, finding support/advice, finding reassurance, symptom focused content, or the like. If you are mainly focused on your physical symptoms, this would be the thread to use. You may also be redirected here if you choose not to follow rule #3 regarding post titles, if it is categorized as one of the post types above, or if the content is too detailed. Remember this is not a place to give or ask for medical/pharmaceutical/veterinary advice, or promote/sell alternative medicines/therapies/products/subscriptions. Please focus on ""**Health Anxiety""** which is defined [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-anxiety)**.** Please avoid displacing others who are looking for support regarding their health anxiety by using other appropriate subreddits for things that are non-HA related  ( r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/AskDocs, r/socialanxiety, r/mentalhealth ). Take the time to comment on each other's entries to show some support while we traverse through HA together. 

Only post a standalone thread if it mainly includes the mental aspect of Health Anxiety. **Everything else goes in this thread.** This megathread is used to prevent any unnecessary distress on somebody who is not mentally prepared to engage with the above content (Imagine scrolling down on your main general feed to relax, but bump into something distressing instead). HA is very unique in which it is very easy for someone to read something/experiences and then come out thinking you may have something after reading it. This is why we take these precautions and use a megathread as navigating through social media is one of the many challenges that our community members face on a daily basis. We are here to accommodate everyone at various stages of their HA. To address visibility concerns the thread is sorted by ""New"", so that it acts as its own reddit feed. An example of a post would be redirected here:

i wish it was talked about more. anxiety is the loudest symptom, so it can be harder to notice the depression, but its just as important. its like depression and anxiety mix up and create this horrible dysphoria where the entire world seems like a nightmare. these days when i have a health trigger, depression is what hits me the hardest. i feel like im gonna die and i lose the ability to enjoy anything. it feels like im just biding time until the inevitable happens. a lot of people think about hypochondria as this caricature of a dramatic person trying to get attention, and i really wish they understand just how much suffering we have to go through. no one ever thinks about how much of a toll it can take on someone. i used to lay in bed all day feeling too depressed to get up and take a shower. i would stop doing the things i enjoyed because i felt like there was no point in anything anymore. i wouldn't even tell anyone about what i was going through because i was too ashamed. i knew i was delusional and i didn't want people to think i was crazy. these kinds of experiences get really overlooked. it feels like no one understands what im going through. they think its just one anxiety attack and then it's over, but the depression/anxiety can span MONTHS and take even longer to fully recover from.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/118tqn7/the_depression_ha_causes_is_so_overlooked/,1677057741.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

e1tfws,HealthAnxiety,Fear of Alzheimer‚Äôs at 23.,"I turn 24 next month and recently I‚Äôve begun fearing Alzheimer‚Äôs after I‚Äôve been experiencing some brain fog. I went through a phase of panicking about ALS since I was having (and still do have) muscle twitching. I had an MRI for it last Monday and my fear of ALS has faded over the past month or so. I‚Äôve just been more worried about if they‚Äôll actually find something wrong with my brain on the MRI. And because I have a family history of Alzheimer‚Äôs (my grandmother had it), of course my mind went there as soon as my brain started getting foggy. I‚Äôve been forgetting little things (forgot the word for smoothie the other day when i was placing an order, for example) and it took me a minute to remember the last movie I saw in theaters when I was asked about it. 

I‚Äôve also been mixing up my words and I‚Äôve had to slow down when reading because of it. I know these are all classic signs of brain fog caused by anxiety and lack of sleep, both of which I suffer from. But my brain just NEEDS something to worry about, it seems üôÑ I don‚Äôt wanna bring this up to anyone in my real life because I know I sound crazy. I‚Äôm turning 24 next month, a disease like Alzheimer‚Äôs should be the LAST thing on my mind when I‚Äôm still so young.

rwzl8c,HealthAnxiety,How to overcome fear of ALS?,"To me, ALS is the most terrifying disease in all of medicine that is relatively well known to the general public due to it being certain death with nothing anyone can do and being a particularly cruel way to die in how it locks you into your own body while you're fully aware before putting you out of your misery.  And things don't seem like they'll change anytime soon despite scientists' efforts.  I've always assumed ALS was very rare but with the publicity it's received and Wikipedia describing it as the the third most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, I've come to believe that it's more common than I thought.

As such, I constantly scan my body for symptoms of ALS and often convince myself that I have them and will die soon.  I haven't found any clinical weakness, which is good, but the problem is that the sites I read say things like hyperreflexia, the Hoffman sign and muscle fasciculations are associated with anxiety as well (which I obviously have).  It seems like a vicious  cycle where the more I worry about ALS, the more ""symptoms"" of it I have and the more I worry.  I should add that I'm in my 20s.  The internet makes it seem like just about any symptom affecting movement or the muscles (twitching, cramping, stiffness, weakness etc) not attributable to an obvious acute cause equals ALS, MS, brain cancer or some other serious neurological condition.  

I also ended up on ALS forums reading too much about people's experiences with ALS.  I was particularly struck by cases of young people near my own age or in their 30s getting the disease (or seriously thinking they have it to the point of ending up in a neurologist's office) even though a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5538408/) said that only 10% of ALS patients were under 45 at diagnosis.  Additionally, there are many people on forums who think they have ALS despite normal EMGs and exams from doctors.  For example, [this](https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Tongue--Atrophy-emg/show/293053) patient thinks their *neurologist* doesn't understand ALS and [this](https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS/Clean-EMGs-but-progressive-issues-for-18-months/show/993999) patient still finds reasons to think they might have ALS despite being deemed not to by two neuromuscular specialists and 3 EMGs.  Can these people really be right and their doctors wrong?  I found out that benign fasciculation syndrome, or BFS, can mimick early ALS but I read someone in a forum saying that their doctor had seen more ALS than BFS making it seem like BFS is actually less common than the real thing while others sites say that BFS is common.  I've also read that ALS can present as just twitches and cramps for a while before weakness sets in while other sources say that weakness always accompanies or precedes twitching.  Finally, I've read multiple posts from patients who say they got a normal EMG at first before later being diagnosed with you-know-what.  I've gotten to the point where I've become hyper aware of my body and think that every little twitch of a muscle and every little ache is ALS.  I don't even have the level of twitching described on /r/bfs and would have thought nothing of it in the past.  I first experienced this fear in my teens before it when into remission for some years.  Back then, I was just afraid of getting ALS, now it's a more classic hypochondria.

I don't know how this has got into my head, but you know how these things can suddenly take hold, right? You read something by mistake, or someone tells you something you didn't want to hear about how this guy got diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his 30s or whatever, and suddenly it's occupying your every waking moment. These ideas have taken root in my mind and I can't make them go away.

I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years, and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. I know intellectually that the symptoms I'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this, but still. I can't stop thinking about it. I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy, and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.

It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I ""should"" know, which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. Can't instantly recall all my PINs and passwords? Dementia. Can't find the right word while I'm talking? Dementia. Repeat myself while I'm typing a sentence? Dementia. Can't remember who starred in that film I saw last week? Dementia. Can't remember every detail of my journey to work? Dementia. It's taken me ages to write this. Dementia.

Flash forward a few years, and I see myself sat in a chair unable to recognise my family :-(. It's horrible.

ldq57l,HealthAnxiety,Scientific evidence of stress vs relaxation on the body.,"I am a medical student who also suffers from health anxiety. It's a perfect combination and apparently not at all uncommon.  


I recently took a selective that addressed the importance of deep breathing and yoga to treat various issues. For instance, doctors aren't even to prescribe meds for back pain until the patient does yoga or something for 6 months. So the AMA takes it seriously.

I thought it was just some fluffy stuff to pad my CV, but then I tried the deep breathing and I couldn't believe how well it worked for me. I have uncontrollable isolated systolic hypertension despite being young and an athlete. Nothing touched it, my meds would only bottom out my diastolic but not touch my systolic. So many doctors told me it was my stress, but I didn't believe them because I didn't think I was stressed.  


After meditating and doing deep breathing for 2 weeks, my BP went from 150/80 to 125/80. Incredible.  


Most interestingly for me is noticing that I salivate A LOT when meditating. I looked into it, and sure enough, salivating is controlled by your vagus nerve, which means that when I was meditating, I was ACTIVELY turning on my parasympathetic nervous system.

It has helped me in so many ways. I am no longer twitching (and thinking I have ALS), your bowels are mainly innervated by your vagus nerve, so I am no longer constipated (and thinking I have colorectal cancer), I don't have brain fog (and thinking I have Alzheimer's etc), my tremors have diminished significantly (so I'm not thinking about Parkinson's anymore).

Deep breathing and meditating has helped me so much and there is good science behind it. It's not fluffy soft science, you can switch your parasympathetic nervous system on, and it can help you so much.

It helped me and I hope it helps you too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/ldq57l/scientific_evidence_of_stress_vs_relaxation_on/,1612586870.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
n1fm2p,HealthAnxiety,Dementia Scare/Neurodegenerative," Hello all! 27 year old male here. I‚Äôm going through a pretty bad spot mentally right now in regards to my health anxiety. Ive always been a worrier, but this past year or so has been the absolute worst I have ever experienced in regards to my anxiety.

 Over the past year, I believe I‚Äôm declining cognitively. I can still remember things, but when someone is talking to me I have to fight hard not to zone out and I frequently forget things. I have a strange ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù feeling constantly. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm slightly tipsy. I‚Äôm in a constant state of thinking I‚Äôm going to die soon due to some illness, specifically any form of dementia. I‚Äôve googled symptoms of a multitude of different types, and of course I feel like I match them.

 As stated earlier, I can still remember things. I often find myself having a slow recall however and it seems like it takes me longer to process information. For example, if you asked me about a certain memory it may take me a little longer to remember(5-10 seconds). I don‚Äôt recall having these cognitive issues when I was younger. It seems to be getting worse.

 I had blood work done a few weeks ago and the only abnormalities were pre diabetes, low testosterone, and a vitamin D deficiency. I‚Äôm taking supplements for the vitamin D, and am on TRT for my low testosterone. I‚Äôm also dieting to lower my blood sugar.

 Everything else came back normal. I had an MRI about 2 years ago due to an ear problem and was told everything looked fine. 

 Aside from that, I‚Äôm not on any medications. I have never been diagnosed with a disease with the exception of anxiety. I‚Äôm constantly worried my symptoms are due to an untreatable and fatal illness like dementia. I‚Äôve even researched that certain dementias can occur at my young age.

I started having a lot of noticeable mental fatigue and forgetfulness and what I hope is dissociation as I just doing anything doesn‚Äôt feel, right, anymore, that‚Äôs the best I can put it. Like nothing in reality seems right. But it‚Äôs making me anxious caused I‚Äôve never been this fatigued and questioning before in my life.

1fii0cm,SleepDisorders,"Please help! Constant brain fog, extreme anxiety, never feel refreshed after sleeping 8 hours, fatigue etc. seems to just be getting worse :(","I need some advice please!

I am in my early twenties, and throughout my life, I have always suffered with anxiety, brain fog, and fatigue. The past ten years of my life have been hell, with all of these being magnified tenfold.

The past ten years, even after sleeping for 7 -8 hours, I wake up feeling half dead, not remotely refreshed, and wanting to crawl back into my bed. As I said, brain fog, anxiety and fatigue are the main symptoms, but there are more symptoms. 

The only way these symptoms can become reduced is if I sleep for 10-12 hours, but this is not sustainable. However, when I do sleep for 12 hours everyday, I feel much better, but still not 100 normal. 

I have gotten some blood tests done, seem to be normal, but my iron is on the lower end. 

I eat extremely heathy, minimal sugar/junk, I lift weights/run every other day, however my capacity to do this has also been severely affected.

My sleep seems to be ""normal"" to my knowledge, I am skinny, and lightly snore, my sleep study did not show any substantial apneas either.

This is all so weird, and I have not found anyone on the net with these kinds of symptoms or their level of extremity,

For the past 10 years I have lost out on my life, and no idea what it is to live a normal life.

Can someone please give me some ideas or steer me in the right direction??

What kind of sleep disorder could this be?

1fcl1t5,SleepDisorders,"Vivid nightmares and nighttime anxiety are affecting my sleep
","I‚Äôve been having trouble sleeping. Occasionally (about once every three weeks), when I‚Äôm about to fall asleep, I start feeling extremely anxious, becoming fearful of any unfamiliar sounds I hear. As I‚Äôm drifting off, I often experience nightmares, which feel incredibly vivid and realistic. These nightmares usually take place in my room, where something bad happens‚Äîlike being pulled by something, getting stuck in a kind of loop or I have experiences similar to sleep paralysis, although I think I‚Äôm dreaming that I‚Äôm paralyzed rather than actually being paralyzed. When I wake up, I feel intense anxiety, and I can‚Äôt go back to sleep because I‚Äôm afraid it will happen again.

Sometimes, it feels like I‚Äôm still in the dream, even after waking up. My mind starts racing with thoughts, and I have trouble falling back asleep, though I usually manage to. However, last night was different‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt sleep after it happened, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.

174ybm8,SleepDisorders,PLEASE HELP!!! sleep anxiety/psych meds,"I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE INSIGHT ON SLEEP ISSUES, PSYCH MEDS, AND MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODIVERGENCE 

Context:
I have ADHD, OCD, anxiety/depression, c-ptsd, and autism. Because of this, falling asleep and going back to sleep is hard because of racing thoughts, sensory issues, etc. 

I have been on 20+ psych meds, a lot of which have made issues worse for me. Some of ""masked"" my sleep issues which makes it harder to sleep off them, and some caused vivid/excessive dreaming. (more on this later*) This is what really started to fuel my sleep anxiety/fear. The only constant on that I've been on is Adderall (a few months ago I switched from IR to XR for my afternoon ‚Äúbooster‚Äù) 

More recently: 
A few weeks ago, I went off of Zyprexa (I have been on it and other similar drugs before but keep going off bc horrible side effects, but then start again bc I can‚Äôt fall asleep), quit THC completely, and started Buspar (3x daily). My life has been hell ever since. 

Over the past few weeks, my nights have looked like this: I have a ton of trouble falling asleep, but do eventually. Anywhere from a few minutes to an hour later, I‚Äôll wake up. Then  I‚Äôll like, kinda be asleep but feel awake and am having racing thoughts and anxiety in general the whole time. I start waking up over and over every few minutes and falling back ‚Äúasleep‚Äù into this state until eventually I‚Äôm too anxious and I‚Äôm wide awake. 

I‚Äôll often take a Xanax/Ativan (been prescribed them ‚Äúas needed‚Äù for about a month and a half now) after and sometimes it helps, but it‚Äôs becoming less effective; I‚Äôm still anxious, and by the time I take it I‚Äôve already suffered and still only get a few hours of sleep. I‚Äôve taken them before bed and again sometimes it helps, but it‚Äôs not a good daily option, but my ‚Äúas needed‚Äù keeps getting more frequent thought

I‚Äôve tried OTC sleep meds but they haven‚Äôt worked for more than one night. So, about a week ago I started Hydroxyzine, and it makes me physically tired at first, but I still have the same problems as mentioned above. My body is doing everything in it‚Äôs power for me not to sleep. Since starting Hydroxyzine, my dreams have 100x longer/more vivid/more realistic too. 

*More on the dreams: These dreams felt/feel like they happen in real time and I‚Äôm not actually sleeping because of how vivid they are. I remember every single thing about them, just like they‚Äôre movies. They‚Äôre triggering, distressing, and exhausting. I wake up from them too. 

I‚Äôve been doing all of the recommended ‚Äúsleep hygiene‚Äù things (warm bath, listening to podcast/meditation, no social media before bed, etc.) but nothing seems to help. My brain is too loud and too powerful. My therapist feels hopeless/stuck, my psychiatrist feels hopeless/stuck, and I feel hopeless/stuck. 

I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle where I‚Äôm so anxious about sleeping that my body won‚Äôt sleep, not matter how tired it is, which just makes me more anxious. Every night is torture and it gets harder and harder to sleep every night.

16eycrn,SleepDisorders,"Circadian rhythm disorder, eating disorder or anxiety? Sudden onset of chronic insomnia after ending intermittent fasting diet plan.","The symptoms:

Extreme insomnia started after I made major changes to my eating patterns, and also exercise patterns. I now struggle to sleep for even 5 hours, often getting much less than this. I've become hyper alert and easily disturbed by even the slightest noise.

Breathlessness has came on alongside the insomnia, where I feel that I can't get enough breath. I'm low weight, low to healthy blood pressure and I've been checked with an ECG and the results were superb. The nurse suggested it could be a circadian rhythm disorder.

I'd been following a routine of intermittent fasting for the past year or so, going on two years. I would eat once or twice a day, from 4-6pm until about 9-11pm. Carbs were restricted, but not keto low. Carbs made up only about 25% of my calories. I'd typically have under 150g of carbs a day, down to 100g.

Around 2 months ago, after successfully losing a lot of weight, reducing my BMI from nearly 30 to 23, I decided to stop dieting and try to eat normally again.

I stopped fasting and began to eat 3 to 4 meals a day, evenly spaced about every 4 hours, beginning with breakfast at 10am. I upped my calories mostly by doubling my carb intake, so I was longer carb restricted or calorie restricted.

This seems to have messed me up entirely. Here are key details which I thought may be relevant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I spent much of the past 1-2 years in a calorie restricted, carb restricted state (lowish carb) 100-150g.

During this period my weight dropped from 94kg to 74kg.

During this time I would go for two long walks on most days, walking about 3-4 miles each walk.

I also did regular exercises to attempt to manage by back pain.

I would get up at 9-10am and then not eat until 4-6pm. I would sometimes eat a second time at about 9-11pm.

I stuck to a food comes later in the day style of fasting, a 4-6 hour eating window, followed by 18-24 hours of fasting. I'd eat my first meal in the early evening,  sometimes had a second meal 4-6 hours later.

Skipping breakfast and lunch came easy to me, like it was natural.

This was a diet that was lower carb, with higher fats and protein. This takes longer to digest and keeps you full for longer.

All of my eating was in this roughly 4-6 hour window through the very late afternoon to evening period.

I would then go to sleep at about 1am, I guess with my stomach full from having all of my food intake in the previous several hours.

I was not hungry while sleeping. After waking up the next day, I wouldn't even think about food until at least the afternoon.

I would typically go for a walk, often a long walk, fasted, during the day, before any meals came.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My insomnia started after I changed this routine.

I stopped doing these long 18-24 hour fasts

I switched my eating window to a smaller meal about every 4 hours, starting from 10am. I'd shifted the intake of food to begin about 8 hours earlier than it usually would.

I wasn't consistent with the new routine 100% of the time, as I do not feel hungry in the morning - though I did stick with it mostly, and the more I forced myself to stick to it, the worse my insomnia and breathlessness seemed to get.

I increased my calories so I wasn't dieting any more. The increase was mainly from carbs.

1kki0ya,SleepDisorders,"Weird sleep disorder happening many times each night before finally following asleep. Started and has been worsening since 2020. (Neurological condition, Covid vaccine side effect, brain tumor) Getting very scary","Hello, I‚Äôm a 47 year old white male from Florida with no other medical conditions or on any medications currently. Not a drinker or recreational drug user. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù tall and 210 lbs. So just slightly overweight, but would consider myself a slender build. Over the last 4 years I have suffered from various different sleep disorders ranging from insomnia one night to feeling like I have narcolepsy, as well as sleep paralysis and sleep walking, But for the past 4 years (gradually went from once a month to every night now) I‚Äôve experienced something I can‚Äôt even find  a diagnosis of online! Every night that I go to sleep when I reach what I would say level 2 sleep my mind realizes that I am sleeping. This cause me to jump up in fear and sit up in bed) as I‚Äôm in a scared shocked state like someone who was woken while sleep walking. My chest tightens as I try to calm myself and get my breathing normal. I‚Äôve had my wife watch me nap, and she said it‚Äôs not me holding my breath. It‚Äôll even happen just laying down for a quick nap. I‚Äôve had some nights where this has happened around 8 times before I actually fell asleep for the night. I‚Äôm scared there is some neurological disorder that doesnt shut my awake brain off completely until I‚Äôve reached level 3, or I have a tumor, or the timing of this coincides with Covid (could this be vaccine related?) I‚Äôve tried Ambien‚Ä¶that just gave me lucid dreams and increased the chances of sleep paralysis. The only thing that has prevented this and let me fall immediately to sleep is taking a small piece of my wife‚Äôs zanex before bed‚Ä¶but seeing this story seems so strange an unbelievable and I‚Äôm in Florida, good luck for me getting a script from a primary care physician. Every doctor and pharmacy doesn‚Äôt care what you need if it means they have to fill out a a controlled substance form. It‚Äôs utterly despicable. 

Even as I lie in bed waiting to fall asleep, I can almost feel a buzz in body signaling I am falling into level 1 sleep. On bad nights I‚Äôve used this sensation as a cue to sit up and prevent myself from falling out‚Ä¶figuring the more exhausted I become the better chance of me going right into a deeper level of sleep right away.

1hh7yze,SleepDisorders,"Never tired, can't sleep, waking up in panic attacks","I wanted to flair this as both ranting and needing advice but I can't do that. I've always had trouble sleeping since childhood (traumatic upbringing, CPTSD lifelong). I've tried Lunesta (is that even in the market anymore?), Ambien (didn't make me fall asleep, just made me do weird shit at night only to come to in the morning feeling rested but knowing I had just been dissociated), melatonin, Benadryl (taking 100mg a night because 25 -75 does not work and 100 works maybe 60% of the time), melatonin/Benadryl combo, magnesium, chamomile, breathing exercises and meditation... The list goes on and on. Within the past year, I went back on my Buspirone (non-benzo anxiolitic) to see if that would help me sleep. It does not help me sleep, but I'm not waking up in panic attacks anymore. I sleep with earplugs in because the slightest noise such as a car driving by or a neighbor's door shutting will wake me from my previous sleep in a jolt. I'm getting average 4 hours a night, sometimes zero. I went to my doctor and she put me on Trazodone 25mg and I literally laid awake all night last night. I was actually sleepy before taking it - a rare occurrence - like maybe twice a year I get sleepy at a semi normal time. Before I took the Trazodone, thinking ""oh yeah, this will really knock me out and I'll sleep like a baby.""  Not the case. If anything it woke me up. I had been prescribed Trazodone previously at 100mg and had the same experience. Honestly, the only thing that helps me get angel baby sleep where I feel refreshed and not sore and exhausted in the morning is Xanax but doctors don't want to prescribe that. I got a psych referral so hopefully the psychiatrist can help more than my doctor. I'm sure there are plenty of CPTSD sufferers out there that can relate. What were your solutions? Sleep study? I really just want benzos because they work but requesting benzos is a red flag to any medical provider so I gotta make it their idea I guess? IDK, I'm going insane from sleep deprivation.

Let me start by saying that I‚Äôve never had trouble sleeping before. For someone who‚Äôs 17 years old, I think I‚Äôve had a pretty solid sleep schedule: never in bed later than 11, waking up at 8:30, and I stay off my phone for at least an hour before bed.

All of this started after a really bad experience with a snorer during a school trip. It was so bad that I ended up buying my own room at 2 a.m. just to get some sleep.

Fast forward a few months to last week‚ÄîI went to a summer camp, and the night before we left, I had a full-on panic attack just thinking about having to sleep in a room with other people. Because of this, I brought some Lexaurin (bromazepam) with me to help calm myself in case of another panic attack. I ended up getting my own room there, too.

Now fast forward again‚Äîit's 1 a.m. on the day I got back from camp, and here I am, sitting in my own bed, unable to fall asleep. This time, it's not so much the panic. I did take Lexaurin again just in case‚Äîbut now it‚Äôs more that my mind is racing a million miles an hour, and I just can‚Äôt seem to fall asleep no matter what I do. I‚Äôve tried breathing exercises, walking around, reading, praying‚Äînothing seems to help. If anyone has advice, I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful.

I should also mention that the summer camp was constant work‚Äîwe were running a mock 51st state government (Colorado Boys State)‚Äîand I worry that the panic I felt there is going to keep showing up now, even at home.

Is there anything I can do to stop or at least ease the anxiety and panic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepdisorders/comments/1l5evng/how_to_sleep_well_again/,1749280393.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1llm01b,SleepDisorders,"Having trouble staying asleep at night while dealing with family health, career and trauma","Hello,

I am a 31 y/o female, full time employee, married one and half year ago.

I have had anxiety problems since past 2 years now. I had some big changes in my life which turned my normal life to a chaotic mess.

In 2023, I decided to tell my parents about my intention to get married to the guy I was dating. My mother disapproved strongly. We had lots of fights, she would send me long texts, call me up during office hours, so much so that I moved out of my house for couple of months. That's where I first started getting these anxiety attacks at night. I would wake up at 3 and then could not go back to sleep as my heart kept racing. I saw psychiatrist, he gave me medicines which helped me sleep for a while but I would feel sluggish the whole day, so I slowly stopped taking them. Eventually my mother agreed and I got married to same guy. My sleep issue was somewhat reduced.

Then in 2024 march we shifted to our new home (just us two), and had to deal with lot of new challenges as we (me & my husband) never really lived on our own before. We started to fight frequently and It gave me the same anxiety. I started facing sleep problems again. Eventually we worked things out between us, made some positive changes in our life and our relationship became stronger and the love between us grew alot. But I still had some issues. My sensitivity to bird noises at night was still present. I tried alot but it would not go away. I started sleeping with earplugs on.

In July 2024, my father suffered a heart attack, and my somewhat normal life again became chaos. Since I'm an only child I had to go and deal with the situation while managing my own home and my career. After discharge my mom would often call me up and tell me if there was any issue with my dad's health in very anxious tone (many a times it were calls to complain that my father wasn't taking meds). It started triggering me and again I faced sleeping problem.

The whole year went like this, I tried making many positive changes, like having balanced diet, working out, keeping journal, painting for relaxation, going out with friends, playing some sport. Told my mom to not give me panic calls at night. I started coming to terms with the issue I had with my parents. I tried dealing with the high sensitivity to bird sound, and eventually it stopped bothering me. I started sleeping peacefully.

But then two weeks ago, when I visited my parents over weekend, my father (severe diabetic patient) got serious and was admitted. After two days, he passed away. I was prepared that something like this might happen because with each doctor's visit, we were not getting any positive consultation. His health was deteriorating rapidly. And we were not financially equipped to handle the medical expenses. We were relying on my relatives to help us out. So whenever my dad got sick, I would immediately get anxious over medical expense.

Now we have another patient at home, my uncle, who is severely diabetic as well and it is making me go through same thoughts and stress again as we are close family. He doesn't have his own family (he never married)

Now I am in constant fear of getting sick like my father as the type 2 diabetes is genetic. I want to stay in good health as I want to have kids soon, but I don't want to give them mentally, physically or emotionally unhealthy mother. My husband has been incredibly supportive so far. But I don't want to depend too much on people or medicine to get my mental health back to normal.

So here I am, asking for help. I am planning to go see doctor, but I am not very positive on it. I know there are somethings I must do in order to overcome this. But just want to be inspired by listening to your stories of dealing with similar anxiety or traumas to keep fighting this battle. And if you could give me some pointers to manage my sleep issues or stress, any any of it, it's most welcome.

Here what I have tried so far

1kmxswp,SleepDisorders,How I got through sleep troubles,"I'm not sure what type of disorder I'd call this, I used to get real bad panic attacks at night when I was young. So young in fact that I had absolutely no idea what a panic attack was for years after they started. I remember counting how many time it happened, but I quickly lost count. I tried multiple melatonin a night, but it didn't help. I used to sleep next to my mom (mind you I was ~5-10 years old when this woukd happen) and she saw it as an inconvenience to get rid of as fast as possible.. which, predictibly, ALSO did not help.

So I went to get checked out for it, and this doctor recommended prioritizing the things you think about at night, 1 being the least concern and 3 being top priority. That was a big step for me as I had no way of coping. Another thing said was that recognizing you cannot do anything in the moment, as you try to sleep, can also be a good thing. Knowing that you must complete something during the day. Then, a while later, I was introduced to the 5-4-3-2-1 senses grounding method by my therapist. I highly recommend this one as it helps me almost every time I experience panic and insomnia.

I recommend a cool sleepong environment, maybe just one soft thin blanket, a stuffed animal, and white noise or sleeping sounds. These all help me. If you cannot get your room dark enough, sleep masks are great. I used to wear them when I was younger.

While I still need to use 5 milligrams of melatonin to ensure I get to sleep at might, now my thoughts don't bother me and keep me up at night hardly as often as they used to. You can take this advice and apply it as needed. All I'm saying is that you can bend these 'rules' in order to get to sleep if it benefits you.

1l694xv,SleepDisorders,Never Feel Rested‚ÄîConstant Fatigue Despite 10+ Hours of Sleep,"**TL;DR:**  
I (36F), generally healthy, and sleep 9‚Äì10 hours a night, but never wake up refreshed. I struggle to get out of bed, have vivid dreams, daily headaches, and feel tired even after exercise. Naps help but are usually 1-2hrs and can still sleep normally after. Seeing a doctor soon but wondering if others have had similar experiences.

**Post:**  
Hi all, I (36F) have my doctor‚Äôs appointment coming up in a couple of weeks, but I can‚Äôt stop obsessing over my sleep issues. I‚Äôve always been a bit of an odd sleeper, but lately, things feel like they‚Äôve gotten worse, and it‚Äôs really affecting my quality of life.

I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, I eat fairly well, and I stay moderately active‚Äîsurfing or working out a few times a week. I work a desk job that gives me 0 stress, don‚Äôt take any medication (including for ADHD, which I have), and don‚Äôt have kids. So on paper, things should be manageable‚Äîbut I‚Äôm constantly exhausted.

Even if I go to bed around 11 p.m. and wake up naturally at 9 a.m., I rarely feel rested. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm forcing my body to wake up through molasses. Alarms don‚Äôt work on me‚ÄîI‚Äôll snooze them endlessly and fall right back asleep, no matter how badly I want to get up, even for things I enjoy like surfing or important things like exams or flights.

My sleep is often filled with strange, vivid dreams where I can‚Äôt move or control my body, or I‚Äôm stuck in cars I can‚Äôt steer. Occasionally, I wake up gasping for air, but that‚Äôs less common. Most mornings I have a dull, tension-like headache that may ease after a few hours but never fully disappears. Moving my jaw gives brief relief, but the ache stays.

I can usually nap for 1‚Äì2 hours and feel a little better afterward. Even after cold-water surfing, I‚Äôll sometimes still feel tired. It‚Äôs like nothing cuts through the fog. Emotionally, I‚Äôm not depressed‚ÄîI‚Äôm actually interested in life and things I enjoy‚Äîbut I feel stuck in this low-energy state. It‚Äôs frustrating and isolating.

**To visualise, what I crave is a morning filled with light and cool fresh air, but I feel like I am perpetually stuck in a dimly lit, stuffy room.**

Until recently, I thought this was just how life is‚Äîmaybe a part of getting older‚Äîbut a conversation with a much younger ex made me realize that constantly waking up tired isn‚Äôt normal.

1jwczvc,SleepDisorders,hypnopompic hallucinations & sleep paralysis - should i see someone?,"long read, sorry! 

(28 F, if it matters) i‚Äôve had sleep paralysis for almost 10 years now, to the point where i‚Äôm fully aware when it‚Äôs happening and i can pull myself out pretty quickly (pro tip - aggressively wiggle your fingers and toes lol). it‚Äôs not usually scary except for the fact that more often than not it comes with trouble breathing, though every once in a while it can get pretty terrifying - seeing, feeling, hearing demonic things.

i also experience hypnopompic hallucinations almost daily - especially if i nap. these usually aren‚Äôt scary at all; they‚Äôre actually quite pleasant sometimes and very ‚Äúnormal‚Äù - i‚Äôll hear my mom talking on the phone, i‚Äôll feel someone playing with my hair while i lay on their stomach, etc. - so they aren‚Äôt too bothersome but they‚Äôre getting increasingly vivid and starting to mess with my head a bit. sometimes they pair with paralysis and it will take what feels like an eternity to wake up, sometimes gasping for air and more often than not deeply disoriented and struggling to land in reality. 

i‚Äôve also seen an uptick in rather aggressive brain ‚Äúzaps‚Äù that jolt me awake right before i‚Äôm about to sleep. those are very unpleasant as it feels like something in my brain just broke lol. 

all these make for a very annoying sleep experience and i just feel like something isn‚Äôt right up there. i know these problems are often associated with anxiety/stress but i‚Äôm not really feeling either right now, at least not to a level where my sleep should be affected like this nearly every day. i get 7-9 hrs of sleep on average, with the interruptions. should i see a sleep specialist? a neurologist? would that be pointless since this isn‚Äôt exactly treatable? has anyone successfully gotten rid of any of these issues? ugh. any tips help. thanks!

1htcqt6,SleepDisorders,REM sleep disorder/ADHD/depression/perimenopause/leg and foot cramps,"Hi all. 36/F So I‚Äôve been battling bad sleep for 20 years and was put on a antidepressant 12 years ago because I wasn‚Äôt getting restful sleep and the dr surmised it was that I was doing too much and not coming down from the adrenaline (I was working in a law firm full time, grad school full time, and nannying in between). It seemed to help a lot and got me through the last semester of grad school and when I graduated, I got off the med thinking that I didn‚Äôt need it anymore as I was not living such a busy life. Fast forward 1.5 years and some really stressful life events later, I went back on an antidepressant (for depression this time) and have been on one ever since. But they never work and I‚Äôm on #7 at this point. 

A year before I started on the antidepressant, I started getting cramps in my toes at night. They would last about an hour and stuck to only my toes. Over the past 13-14 years, those cramps have gotten more painful and have progressed to my feet and calf. I have been operating under the impression it was caused by dehydration, but have since ruled that out. 

Additionally, I had a brief period of typical perimenopause symptoms 2 years ago for approximately 6 months. Those symptoms stopped but other ones that could be attributed have popped up here and there. I‚Äôm young for perimenopause (says the drs) but premature menopause runs in my family. 
Last but not least for your consideration, I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2nd grade. I didn‚Äôt start on meds until I was 26 and have been on Vyvanse for the last 10 years. 

Now, starting 6 months ago, I started waking up anywhere between 1-4am and not falling back asleep. As you can imagine, my concentration, memory, and overall functioning are drastically impaired. I spoke to my psychiatrist about it this week and told her about some things I‚Äôd seen in a new sleep app I tried and some video-tapping I‚Äôd done: The app showed frequent spikes of low noise throughout the night. The graph looked like scallops or waves if you will. This led to the video tapping and I discovered that I am moving all night long. Sometimes just a foot or leg or arm stretching movement but mostly a lot of rolling back and forth. 

***She has ordered a sleep study and thinks this may be REM sleep disorder.***

I‚Äôve talked in my sleep well into my 20s and perhaps still do (I don‚Äôt have a sleep partner currently), but have never sleep walked (with one exception as an 8 year old). 

I have very vivid dreams, usually multiple a night that I remember when I wake up and they are not typically nightmares. Just weirdo dreams. And when I wake up (even if I sleep through the night), I‚Äôm usually waking from a dream. 

I never wake up feeling refreshed. 

My legs often feel like they are achy and throbbing when I lay down and wake up. 

I also suffer from nighttime bruxism. I wear a mouth guard for this. 

Magnesium, iron, and zinc levels are normal. 


***Interested if anyone has had a similar experience- specifically with the comorbid depression, ADHD, or perimenopause.***


And if it should matter, I also have grown up with food intolerances: gluten as a kid that I outgrew in my 20s and replaced for a lactose intolerance. That has since been replaced in the last 2 years with an egg allergy.

16rzbf7,SleepDisorders,Can sedating medications cause mild sleep apnea? Home test came back with that result but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the source of my sleep issues at all and I‚Äôm on a ton of meds that cause respiratory depression,"Basically title. I got my home sleep study results back and it says mild obstructive sleep apnea. Now granted this is only what my doctor said and she didn‚Äôt say anything more. I haven‚Äôt gotten the comprehensive results back because they can‚Äôt upload them so I have to pick up a physical copy tomorrow, but regardless I don‚Äôt have the full and complete results sheet yet. 

But I mean I‚Äôm a 20 year old man, I only weigh 130 pounds at 5‚Äô6‚Äù. I don‚Äôt snore more than the average person. I‚Äôve never woken up gasping for air. My father has sleep apnea but he‚Äôs 250 pounds at 6‚Äô and also diabetic so it‚Äôs probably not a genetic thing. And I‚Äôm also on a shit ton of sedating meds that cause respiratory depression so them causing apneas would not surprise me. 

Plus my sleep issues are not being able to fall asleep and then once I do fall asleep I stay asleep for way too long. Like I‚Äôll be unable to sleep until 5am but then once I pass out from exhaustion I‚Äôm asleep till 5*pm*. And then it also takes me an hour or two to get out of ‚Äúsleep drunkenness‚Äù so I spend more time in bed even after I wake up because I‚Äôm too out of it to get up and act fully awake. None of that really sounds like apnea is the cause. 

Anyway, the night I did the sleep study and hooked myself up I took a lot of stuff. At 10:37pm that night I took 1200mg gabapentin, 17.5/650mg oxycodone/acetaminophen(percocet), 25mg amitriptyline, 10mg baclofen, and then later at 4:15am because I still couldn‚Äôt sleep I took 1.5mg of lorazepam. That‚Äôs a lot of stuff that can cause respiratory depression especially when taken together, so I‚Äôm actually a little surprised I didn‚Äôt have more apneas. They might even have said on the result page that it could be due to medications, I‚Äôm not sure cause I haven‚Äôt seen them yet but it‚Äôs possible if not probable.

But I mean I just have a hard time believing that I would have sleep apnea naturally, I think it‚Äôs caused by the meds but I can‚Äôt say for certain. I won‚Äôt know until I get off of them in a few months when the treatment I‚Äôm getting allows my injury to actually heal, and then I‚Äôll hopefully get an in-lab sleep study then. It‚Äôs facial muscle/nerve damage from a botched wisdom teeth surgery I had in June, the muscles locked in place and won‚Äôt relax, and since I use them every day and also don‚Äôt get adequate sleep they never get a chance to heal properly and thus get worse the longer they stay injured. It‚Äôs kinda like when a broken bone is set incorrectly (or not set at all). I‚Äôm getting a special three-point mouth guard tomorrow from this craniofacial pain clinic that will keep the pressure off the muscles and joints and will prevent further damage from jaw clenching (which is also a major problem I have) and also give it the opportunity to actually get better so I can taper off all these medications.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepdisorders/comments/16rzbf7/can_sedating_medications_cause_mild_sleep_apnea/,1695665227.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1m0r4fd,SleepDisorders,Did antidepressants permanently break my brain? Am I doomed to eat in my sleep forever?,"5 years ago my (shitty) doctors put me on amitriptaline for ""chronic pain"". I was told it would help me sleep better and make my pain go away. It did neither, so my (shitty) doctors upped my dose. Ever since then I haven't been able to sleep normally.

Almost immediately after upping my dose I began eating it my sleep. I have never had a sleep problem before it my life prior to this point. But every night I would get up, go to the kitchen, and stuff my face. I'd wake up with food in my bed, on my nightstand, etc. And never remembered actually doing this, beyond vague dream-like memories. I quit the antidepressant because it was also making  me dangerously depressed. I thought my sleep would go back to normal. But it never did. 

To this day I have bouts of sleep eating. Some weeks it's almost every night. Once in a blue moon I'll go a week or two without an incident. There is no pattern to when it happens. When I try to get doctors to help me they only offer me more antidepressants, but I'm never going to take one again as I've tried 8 and they all harmed me in different ways. I also can't afford to have another antidepressant fuck up my sleep permanently.

Is there any hope? Any treatment options? All I see online is antidepressants and CBT. Except neither will help. I do this when I am dead asleep, I'm not in control of my thoughts so therapy would just make me go broke. 

I am a renter so I cannot just start putting up gates and locks in my apartment, if I do any damage I will have to pay. I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I should just get rid of all my food and force my body to sleep without access to food for awhile. I don't know.

1kx4x30,SleepDisorders,I sleep 20+ hrs per day,"In case it is relevant, I am 30F. Before I was wfh, I worked a desk job where I would have the horrible urge to sleep all day. I would often allow myself to take naps at my desk (voluntary) and would sleep my whole lunch break. As soon as I was off work, I'd sleep and stay asleep until the next morning.

I am currently wfh. I somehow manage my job in the four or five waking hours and I only get out of my bed because I don't want my husband knowing I sleep all day.

He knows I struggle with it but not to the extent it's at. I lie a lot about how much I sleep, and cover it by saying I take long naps. On the weekends I sleep in as long as I can, but the rest of my time awake is not spent enjoying whatever activities we have planned. It is spent wishing I were sleeping, sleeping in the car, and trying to get my husband to take naps with me. This has been my life for over 3 years. 

I feel¬†**ADDICTED**. I have seen 3 PCPs who were all are confused by that word, they said there is no addiction to sleep. I believe them, but it's what it feels like. It's causing me to lie, hide my habits, skip events, skip workouts, skip eating, skip showers, etc. so that I can sleep instead.

I saw one sleep specialist who had never heard of this and I feel like she didn't believe me at all, she said to just stop sleeping. That feels impossible. 

Am I just lazy? What is going on?? Anyone experience the same thing?

Other notes I feel that are relevant:

* I do not involuntarily fall asleep.
* I am prescribed sertraline for depression, and it for sure works for all other symptoms I have so I am not completely convinced this is depression related.
* I exercise 3x a week and it does not seem to positively or negatively impact this sleep habit.
* I eat healthy, but not breakfast or lunch as I sleep through them. 1-2 cup coffee/day.

Whenever I wake up I always feel incredibly groggy and tired, and like my body is double its weight. There will be times I wake up and turn off my alarms or someone like a parent literally pulling me out of bed and I will have little to no memory of it happening afterwards even though I‚Äôve been told I was conscious. I feel like a zombie in the morning, like I have no control over what I do. This makes it feel impossible to wake up and get out of bed especially early in the morning. Then there‚Äôs actually going to sleep. I also suffer from insomnia almost every single night. I never feel tired at night unless I‚Äôve had a really rough day or have pulled an all nighter. I‚Äôve tried melatonin a lot but that usually doesn‚Äôt really help.

1j7zrzo,SleepDisorders,What can be the cause of my fatigue and falling asleep during the day?,"I am a 20 year old female.

I just woke up. I'm at school and I fell asleep. Again.

I have been sleeping a lot during daytime for a few years, usually just naps though. I just brushed it of because I have depression and that makes me tired.

Now, during the last 3-4 weeks I have taken a nap EVERYDAY and if I have had school, I have fallen asleep during a lesson, at least once a day.

I have had problems staying awake at school for months, but on on most days I have taken my adhd medication (methylphenidate). I have found that it helps me stay awake and not feel as drowsy.

I have thought that my tendency to fall asleep more easily is some kind of withdrawal symptom. It fells so clearly connected to when I'm of the medication.

I have been complaining about fatigue for my nurses for years and I have had so many blood works done. And they always come back clean.

My sleep schedule has also been messed up for a few weeks, I find it very hard to fall asleep early enough, until I just pass out, sometimes at 4 am.... This might also be a cause for my tiredness.

It doesn't take much,  just few hours with a friend to get me so tired I basically pass out when I get home. But again, I have thought that this was due to my depression.

She is so done with me I mean both my parents are; they think I do it intentionally. She tell me everything I did throughout the night and I don't recall anything cuz honestly i don't but my parents just don't understand. They think the reason is my phone; that whole day I watch inappropriate horror stuff and because of that I react at night. 
I've been telling them that I don't watch anything of such kind but they just don't wanna listen to me. 
I feel I'm mentally depressed n I literally have none by my side who'd wanna hear me or understand me and whenever I tried they think I'm calling out to gain sympathy.
For the record my parents hate me for being a girl, they see me as a burden and upon that they can't take all this from my side. So they have clearly warned me not to use phone or watch anything or that they'll confiscate my phone - even from the very first they were against providing phone to a daughter. 
I'm not strong enough by heart; I can't watch thriller horror documentary stuff so my escape is soft anime that's it.
Some time it so happen that my mom hit me when my movements wake her up and even after that I don't wake up and the next I don't recall anything; this time she has warned me that she'd hit me on my face until I wake up and ik she will n can do that. I know I'm disturbing their sleep sometime even my dad wakes up hearing my voice from next room; then the next morning they'll start with how they shouldn't have bought me into this world and that I am a curse and everything goes all lengths with their words and I just listen cuz I can't help_ I'm helpless and I'm genuinely in need of some help any way. The other day I put cloth in my mouth so to not scream but then it was suffocating so I had to remove it. I even try not to sleep but I'm an active sleeper and sleep has always been my escape from this reality at my place.

Diagnosed mild sleep apnea (AHI 13) and delayed sleep phase disorder. I've had an overnight sleep study but not a MSLT. Had a titration study for CPAP which failed due to TECSAs. 

Doctor didn't think I should bother with PAP therapy despite the apnea, said it's mild when on my side so I should just learn to sleep on my side. And for the delayed sleep phase, I should just go to bed at 9pm, wake up earlier, and stop napping. Her response to me saying that's impossible for me is in the title, ""drink more caffeine"" - caffeine doesn't wake me up, 1 cup of tea or coffee does nothing at all, and if I have more than that it just upsets my stomach and gives me diarrhea and if anything makes me more tired. 

I had to push to try PAP therapy for the apnea. My dr hasn't bothered to make it easy for me I guess since she didn't think I should do it. It's been a bureaucratic nightmare. Took 2 months to even get one (in part because she ""forgot"" to upload the prescription for several weeks) and I've been trying it for a month and I think I just completely cannot tolerate it. The pressures required to treat my apnea are genuinely intolerably painful. 

Oh, and my doctor also seemed to get annoyed when I told her I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I'm trying stimulants for that. She asked if I even wanted to carry on with the sleep stuff or if I was just interested in ADHD now. I burst into tears on on video call, so frustrated and tired and overwhelmed, tearfully justifying that I'm desperate to resolve whatever my sleep issue is. So then she decided I'm just depressed.

I have migraines, I am a visual person (creative type). I do have some personal fears and anxiety's about loss and abandonment. Most I am aware of consciously but seem to ""relive trauma"" subconsciously when asleep. I have trouble getting tired at a decent time, end up awake most of the night but still function with some lag during the day. I don't work so it's fine if I sleep in. I take B12 and Iron supplements as suggested by my docs due to low numbers.

Reason for Post: So I have been noticing lately that I am having weird experiences surrounding my sleep and waking stages. More than my usual weirdness. Because of the intensities of my dreaming, I often wake up confused of where I am. I have been in my home for the last 11 years, so I have a lot of familiar things around me but even with that I am still unsure of my exact locations. For example, I often dream about being in different houses (most decrepit and dark in nature). Never in my current home. I see lots of faces, some I recognize, most I don't remember when waking. The theme usually some kind of stresser that I am living or have lived in the past. I'll either fight with my X husband or Mom and wake up confused of whom I am sleeping next too or where I am for a few seconds to minutes. I believe that now that I feel safe (ish) in my current relationship and home, that my mind is trying to process years of trauma that it couldn't before because the constant input of stress, anxiety, fighting with family, defending myself constantly, and caring for my two boys during the chaos every day. But with the growing severity of waking up confused, I am wondering if I should consult a doctor or even a psychologist. I do have short memory loss, I will lose chunks of conversations, faces to names, and time frames for occurrences. I am told I am too young for Alzheimer's testing but I really think I have early stages of it because of my mem loss and sleep troubles.   
If there is any professions out there that read this, please feel free to ask questions and respond with thoughts. There is no information that I won't share because I really want to get to a solution and possibly a way to get better.

1g2v99g,SleepDisorders,Not remembering waking up for a slight moment,"Hi. 

So, for the last year or so I've experienced this weird but oddly specific (at least I had a hard time finding anyone with this same exact experience) phenomenon. What happens is I go to sleep, same as everyday, and then when I finally wake up, I realize that I definitely woke up before, but have no memory of it. Some friends tell me I sleepwalk but I never leave my bed and from what my parents have told me, I speak to them like I'm awake. 

Often I notice small things have changed. For example, I always leave my phone charging before going to sleep, and this morning when I woke up it had 100% but was disconnected from the cable, and also it was in airplane mode, which I never use. Often times I listen to ambient music to fall asleep, and just leave it playing the whole night, and on some rare occasions when I wake up, the music has been paused. 

Now, I know these are mostly random and insignificant things, and as long as I feel fine, it shouldn't matter. But at the same time, I can't stop wondering if this is some type of sleeping disorder or even early onset signs of amnesia or something of that sort. I'm in my early 20s and have smoked weed since I was 15, and I'm sure that it did some damage, but maybe I'm just reaching for conclusions.

  
Anyways, just wanted to share my experience and hear your thoughts on this. Thanks for reading.

I won't have any idea where I am and I am just intensely trying to figure out who I am/where I am/ what's going on. It's like I'm a blank slate. Like I totally forgot I existed on this earth. Sometimes it is accompanied by immense panic, other times it is just a lot of confusion but I am relatively calm. It's not that groggy like ""what day is it?"" feeling that you get after a good nap...I have had that like everyone. This is different. It is just complete erasure of my memory. Again, always within 30-60 minutes of falling asleep.  


I'm starting to get really freaked out that I might develop early onset dementia. I feel like my memory is really good though, and I test it regularly and it doesn't feel like it's declining. I feel relatively sharp in my waking life.  


It is worth mentioning, I did mdma recreationally pretty frequently in my early 20s but have been drug free for 5+ years now and these events happen when I am completely sober). I also had an MRI of my brain done last year for other, nonrelated reasons and they found ""Two foci of FLAIR signal present in the right subcortical frontal white matter, nonspecific."" My doctor seemed unconcerned so I didn't have it further investigated. (I assumed it could have been caused by brain damage from my days of heavy mdma use).  


Anyone ever heard of this happening or know what it might be? Does anyone happen to think the brain flair's should be further looked into?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepdisorders/comments/10au9m1/waking_up_with_amnesia/,1673615689.0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0

18j3vkd,SleepDisorders,I (54M) have was diagnosed with RBD in 2012 (probably had it way longer) and currently take 1mg Clonazepam for it. Other options?,"I have always had vivid dreams and have acted out verbally and somewhat physically for as long as I can remember.  In fact, I also can lucid dream, which is really cool when it happens.  But the RBD is a persistent problem that worries me.  Because 1. I foresee a neurological condition in my future (my Dad passed away from Lewy-Body Dementia, and my looking back my grandfather probably had a form of Parkinson's) which I know I can't prevent 2. I worry about hurting my wife and 3. Am I destine for a life on Clonazepam?

My physical actions range from running and kicking to hitting, slapping, biting, and throwing myself out of bed.  I don't sleep walk.  The worst injury to myself, so far, is when I threw myself out of bed and busted my face on the nightstand.  The worst injury to my wife has been the bite on the back of her arm; generally the other ""batterings"" she catches as I become active in my sleep so far so good.

The clonazepam does a fairly good job of controlling my RBD but roughly 1 - 2 times a month I still experience some sort of event.  There have been times (like this week) when I have accidentally forgotten to put my clonazepam in my med box.  The good news is my anxiety and tinnitus are so high by day 2 of withdrawal that I immediately know the problem.  The bad news, the withdrawal sucks both physically and cognitively for a couple days.  I am also concerned about the long term use of it.

I've tried melatonin in the past without much affect.  Is there anything else out there that people have used to combat this besides clonazepam?  I've recently transitioned off of Effexor XR to Lexapro for reasons related to my anxiety, but I was hoping the RBD might get better since Effexor is know for weird dreams an potentially exacerbating RBD.

Just looking for some perspectives from some people who can share from a Bipolar point of view.

I have been in a long-distance relationship with my partner for five years now. Over these five years, we spent 3 of them in school together, and in that time, I got diagnosed with Bipolar II, PCOS, and now possibly IBD. It‚Äôs always been one horrible diagnosis after the next, made even more horrible from managing the mood swings and emotional reactivity. In that time, he‚Äôs graduated college, gotten a full-time job, is constantly out and about doing things he loves while I‚Äôm still struggling to make it through the rest of school.

It‚Äôs time for us to think about whether we can see ourselves in a long-term relationship together. All these years, he and his family have been concerned about my ability to take care of myself and function independently. We‚Äôve talked about this concern again and again. Every single time we do, the more and more I consider just accepting that I‚Äôm not ready, mature, or stable enough for a serious relationship like that. I genuinely believe that we both want to make this work, as much as my brain tries to make me deny that. Help is out there‚Äîthe right meds, the right treatments‚Äîbut can I handle taking on responsibilities if/when things with my health change?

I‚Äôm feeling so hopeless. He is my favorite person in the world. With one health catastrophe after the next, I wish I could for the first time in my life achieve that level of stability I think I need to see a future with him.

- IBD/GERD - after yearsss (like, decades) or upset stomachs and lots of testing, I have IBD. The GERD was a given because of family genetics but I was surprised (but relieved) after this diagnosis. 
- Migraines - I had a pretty bad ocular migraine that sent me to the ER and they thought I was having a stroke. After lots of tests, they determined that was it.

The second article is more in depth.

I was high more than I care to admit and cut again. I hated it. It was miserable. And someone called the cops on me this week saying I was suicidal. I am lucky I wasn't arrested for being high or being back in the hospital on a mental ward.
I had a deal with a few people that I would do therapy, counseling, and a recovery group all once week all summer long and if it didn't work or I became self destructive again I would go to this rehab inpatient program. Well I started being self destructive again so I am beginning that process now.
I was in a wreck this week. My car is totaled. But we can make it drivable again so that's what we're doing. I am hoping it is affordable and I get it back soon.
Today I had surgery.... I have Crohn's disease and been symptomatic for two months now. Hasn't been awesome. So today I did my colonoscopy and she said all looks fine and it is probably an infection.

So life goes on despite being bipolar and all the other mental disorders that I have. This hasn't been an easy week at all neither the week before.

1ghn19s,Bipolar,I'm just a kiiid and life is a nightmare ,"

Title is a joke as I am unfortunately 23 years of age.

Hi so this is a burner, but I just needed to vent a little and maybe get some advice.

I live at home with my parents. I was diagnosed at 18 and before that I dropped out of my senior year bc of the symptoms I was encountering like a year before I went to a psychiatrist. After like four years of having a psych that in the end didn't even think I had bipolar (bc when I went to get another and my files were given to them, I was only listed as having depression/anxiety even though she explicitly diagnosed me with bipolar in 2020), I've been struggling to get my GED so I can actually, you know, be independent and live my life. I have a lot of shame surrounding it but I try and do my part with my family and be as grateful as I can for even having a place to stay at all.

The problem is that my dad is an alcoholic. He isn't physically abusive but he can be emotionally abusive and belligerent when drunk. I've been dealing with this since I was nine. He got a DUI in 2020 and ended up in a jail cell. Was sober for like nine months, then tried it again to see if he could take it.

Anyway, I've been biting my tongue lately even though he's recently lost his job and is stressed. But he gets drunk every night, per usual, and tonight he collapsed on the floor and I found my mother, who's currently experiencing a bad Crohn's flare up, trying to help him. I really couldn't do it anymore. I yanked him up and cursed him out, told him he was an asshole and ""fuck you."" 

I'm seeing my new psych next week and I hope to god that whatever medicine they give me works good so I can get a job by January at least and get myself out. I just wonder if anyone else has been in a similar situation/has advice? Because I've felt alone about it all these years, and it just makes me feel even more singled out as an already very mentally ill person. I had a very bad depressive episode the past month, couldn't even enjoy my birthday really, nor anything else in life, and I really just wish I could be normal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1ghn19s/im_just_a_kiiid_and_life_is_a_nightmare/,1730515969.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
1cb081x,Bipolar,Stuck in nocturnal circadian rhythm,"I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else experiences this, but since the onset of my Crohn‚Äôs, my sleep schedule has become practically nocturnal and extremely difficult to change. I‚Äôve struggled with insomnia and gravitate towards staying up late and waking up late since I was a little kid, but I could switch to an early schedule if needed.

This was the case until my Crohn‚Äôs first flared up and I can‚Äôt adjust my circadian rhythm no matter how hard I try. My class attendance is suffering due to this when I could adjust if needed before. 

It‚Äôs also never been this severe since in the past my body would want to go to sleep at 2am and wake up at noon and I‚Äôd consider that late. Now my body wants to go to sleep at 8am and wake up at 6pm, so literally staying up when it‚Äôs dark outside.

If I try to adjust my schedule and go to bed earlier (1am for example), I will keep waking up in 2-hour increments and have to go through the process of forcing myself asleep multiple times throughout the night. When I sleep on my nocturnal schedule, I‚Äôm out like a light and can sleep the full stretch.

I don‚Äôt know if this is a Crohn‚Äôs thing or something else since I‚Äôm also bipolar, but it‚Äôs only been a significant problem after Crohn‚Äôs.

Sometimes I feel I don‚Äôt have the energy or mental capacity to do even the bare minimum. It just feels like a huge effort to do things that I used to breeze by.

I struggle so hard to adhere to a sleep schedule and my ability to commit to goals has definitely decreased. I had a depressive episode after COVID, a stable period, a manic episode a year ago that lasted 6 months, and I am stable again but with an untreated autoimmune condition (confirmed via ANA but I have to wait a month to see a specialist; I suspect it‚Äôs Crohn‚Äôs) and severe vitamin D deficiency.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like I got hit with a train of well-being issues after COVID. I got a full scholarship to my college and I have imposter syndrome because I haven‚Äôt been meeting the standards I used to set for myself in high school for my whole college career.

I‚Äôve also noticed my mind seems to block out stress. I was highly perfectionistic and hard-working to a fault for about a decade until my manic episode. Now it‚Äôs like my mind refuses to crumble from stress again and won‚Äôt allow me to put any pressure on myself.

17viqgr,Bipolar,It has been more than a year that I was stable. Then I had to take prednisone,"I suppose we all have stories like these, right?

I have my high and lows in professional life, like anyone else, but today sure felt like something else. A small - *small* - issue at work destroyed my day. I wasn't sure it was anger or sadness, but unlike before, it felt so more strongly than before. Like it was for real now, that I would get fired *today*.

I'm not saying my workplace worries aren't valid, but they felt a lot more immediate than before.

I then recalled that I've been taking prednisone after a Crohn's flare-up for a few days, and how paranoid I've been too. It dawned on me that I have been overreacting to these past events, as much as it isn't (fully) my fault. Since my prednisone dosage is relatively low, I'm deciding to cut it now.

I often keep to myself how agitated or how much anger I have when I'm not in control. This is probably something I share with a few here in this community (<3).

As I'm getting the geodon on board regularly now I'm definitely coming down,  super sad emotional and no energy.   I just want balance.   Why is balance so elusive?

166ljb1,Bipolar,My psych changed my diagnosis,"So I‚Äôve been on lamictal for a year, and because that made me sleepy I got put on modafinil. I was also working insane hours at my job. I also had a bit of depression because of my job and because of seasonal changes, so I got put on Wellbutrin.


Anyways, I‚Äôm not going to write an essay for context, just going to keep it fairly bullet pointed and short.

My psych is changing because they‚Äôre leaving to California, and while that‚Äôs a shame we were having a last meeting. I capped the conversation with, ‚Äúyeah and I need to just never take steroids.‚Äù

She paused and asked about if I had steroids that were associated with the singular manic episode I was hospitalized over, and I explained that I was given steroids that strongly exacerbated the delusional manic state I was in. I also broke down the whole story to her, which is summed up in that:

I was 18, suddenly supporting my 14 year old sister, with a sick mom, working 30 hours a week and being a full time college freshman. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping enough and I was smoking a lot of weed. Prior to the manic episode I was sick with mono and strep throat which pulled me out of work and class for two weeks. I tried hitting the ground running and completely crumbled when a close friend of my mine at the time offered to help clean up my moms place. Instead I got home from work and all of my belongings were rearranged and my organization was completely lost. It was midterms and I was scrambling to pass my classes and I just shattered, frankly. I realized the night of my midterms I had a doctors appointment so I stayed up to go to the appointment and that‚Äôs when I was pink slipped and given a steroid. I have Crohns and my doc thought it was a Crohns flare up I guess.

I definitely have ADHD and Anxiety, and I think my depressive symptoms may actually be a long standing untreated Vitamin deficiency, but with that we will see. 

My diagnosis got changed to ‚ÄúMania due to secondary factors, possibly drug induced‚Äù and after spending so much time fighting and eventually accepting a bipolar diagnosis, it‚Äôs a weird place to be.

I also have ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and a couple forms of cancer. This past weekend I actually kind of freaked out about my health just in general because I'm going through some testing right now. I had two non-epileptic seizures this past weekend and I never knew that anxiety in mental health issues could cause seizures. When they drew my labs they said my lithium was at a non-therapeutic level which I actually was not aware of that. The soonest my primary care doctor who prescribes my mental health meds for me to give me in is next Thursday so I can't adjust my meds until then. And they recommended instead of seeing my therapist every other week to see her every week.

The first time it happened was on Saturday and I was home by myself. I was so scared after it happened and I didn't even know anything happened until I came to with my cat on my chest licking my face. The second time it happened was Sunday night and my fiance was here and three of our friends were here. My fiance said that I was shaking my head back and forth shaking my legs back and forth shaking my arms you know classical seizure like activities I was non-responsive but I could hear them trying to talk to me I couldn't turn my head I couldn't answer them.

1lb9ng7,Bipolar,Keep having panic attacks & this morning I had a random full blown attack,"
For context I went through something a few years ago that messed me up. At the time I was dealing with it but having debilitating and persistent nightmares. I deal with bipolar and no matter what I tried I couldn‚Äôt shake it. It got so bad I had to leave the country for 2 months. While it still effected me here and there, I‚Äôve been actively working through therapy to try and help ease myself. Then recently it all changed. 

I‚Äôve been having triggers that have led to random attacks throughout the day. Yesterday I had 3 anxiety attacks. So I took a boat load of meds. Idk what happened but it all cause light sensitivity. So suddenly any light would burn my eyes. And as someone afraid of the dark, it‚Äôs one of the worst experiences. Eventually it faded. I took a Valium and went to sleep. I woke up and asked my roommate for a charger and immediately after I got this charger this fear just came out of no where, suddenly I couldn‚Äôt breath, I kept having events recirculate over and over again to which made it worse. Lasted 2 hrs. The only changes that have been made have been moving from IV ketamine to spravato (but I started that treatment over a month ago) and I recently got diagnosed with H pylori so for the past week I‚Äôve been taking antibiotics. Since Friday (1st day of the antibiotics) I began to get paranoid. I felt like there was a shadow over me which would cause me to anxious but not panicky. But these past couple days I can‚Äôt stop the panic. Idk what to do.  I‚Äôm taking the meds, I‚Äôve been in my therapy to help me cope, I‚Äôm literally doing everything by the book. And yet I‚Äôm still getting panicked. 

I have a vacation for a wedding next week and I‚Äôm so terrified of staying in this household with people. I don‚Äôt like anyone seeing me like this. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me depressed or manic. And the rules with these roommates to say that I need to sleep in the dark and wear a shock watch (I have a rigid time I have to wake up so I have really loud alarms on cuz I can‚Äôt hear it when I sleep) is ridiculous. The dark? I can‚Äôt sleep in the dark, it freaks me out. 

Anyway, what can I do. You mean to tell me when I wake up I‚Äôm scared, paranoid and panicking. And I mean minutes after I wake up and grab a damn charger & now I‚Äôm freaking out for almost 2 hours? How does that even happen? I‚Äôm at a loss and it‚Äôs starting to make me depressed and overall honest to god I‚Äôm so tired of this. It‚Äôs taking a physical and mental toll on me.

1i9ylqx,Bipolar,I have been experiencing anxiety/panic attacks symptoms all day long,"Long story short I started having panic attacks every day since last week. I take a PRN anxiety med and yesterday I just started a higher dosage of my regular anxiety med.

I don't know what to do because anxiety meds will probably 2-4 weeks to kick in. My PRN anxiety med isn't enough. I don't know if I just need an extended-release. It sucks it takes 30 minutes to work. I wish I had something to prevent the attacks, especially the physical symptoms. 

Plus I'm experiencing mood dysregulation so my mood stabilizer was increased last week when I went to a psychiatric urgent care. My psychiatrist wants to later increase my anti-psychotics to help with mood dysregulation as well. 

My mental health disorders are treatment-resistant. I got diagnosed in 2020 and the only difference I'm able to handle taking one sometimes two classes per semester. But my mental health is too disabling to allow me to work even if it was part-time or do college full-time.

Also, I have insomnia still and poor sleep quality. My ENT thinks I should see a sleep neurologist since all the prescribed sleep aids so far never make me sleepy, in other words, help me fall asleep sooner. Plus sleep schedule has pretty much chronically involved me going to bed late afternoon/early evening and waking up every day before 4 am. I get enough sleep every night but I think this sleep issue (I wake up throughout the night sometimes and have trouble falling back asleep) is why my mental health disorders seem to be treatment-resistant. I never realized how important sleep is to mental health. 

I also experience daytime fatigueness but I literally realized this week that drinking green tea would help. I only thought to start drinking it because it helps with anxiety and will also me energy since it has caffeine. It's ideal for me because the anti-anxiety effect allows me to get energy without that caffeine jittery effect and the likes.

I don't know what to do. I have no one to rely on for support. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1i9ylqx/i_have_been_experiencing_anxietypanic_attacks/,1737843378.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Everything I saw seemed to be full time or part time retail paying less than $15/hr. I also just couldn‚Äôt get my foot in the door. My resume gap seemed to hurt me everywhere I went. So much so that back in December, I broke down and opened a case with the Office of Vocational Rehab.

I went to a couple OVR appointments and it didn‚Äôt seem like they were going to offer me anything beyond what I can already do for myself. Then, a few weeks ago, just completely out of the blue, I got a text from an attorney I used to interact with through an old job (I used to work full time for a friend‚Äôs nonprofit, but it was stressful and I only lasted a year). Could I do some part time paralegal work? Her current paralegal is overwhelmed.

I‚Äôm not a certified paralegal but I have a Master‚Äôs Degree in a different field and I‚Äôm a smart person. I can also speak Spanish, which is necessary for working with this attorney‚Äôs clients. I‚Äôm starting with 10 hours a week and I‚Äôm being paid $30/hr! It doesn‚Äôt get much better based on my qualifications and schedule.

The best part? I started today (the 13th anniversary of the day I arrived in the hospital in a state of full blown psychotic mania) and y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ I am in my element.

I can‚Äôt really afford to move at the moment. I‚Äôve had employment and money issues since diagnosis and my current salary is barely enough for the basics and medication. 

The whole situation is stressing me out and I‚Äôm sleeping less than I should. The worst thing that could happen to me right now is being in a manic/psychotic episode. With depression, I can mask like I always do.

For one thing, the meds I'm on now make me forget words all the time, as happens before she is diagnosed. But her experiences as the illness progresses make me think of my times having psychosis. I knew who I was and who my partner was, but I was so unmoored from time and so disoriented, so unclear on how the present moment relates to anything else. I kept trying to eat and drink and lie down and then forgetting that I was doing any of those things, just wandering from room to room not knowing why I had come there or what I was trying to do. I remember right before we left for the hospital I kept trying to put on a winter coat and my partner had to tell me that I didn't need one because it was April, so I listened to him and just put my shoes on, and then I tried to get into bed even though I was fully-clothed. When we were in the car I thought that all the other cars on the highway were going so fast that it must be the apocalypse and everyone must be trying to get out of town before shit hits the fan.

I‚Äôm also taking hormonal birth control, and it wasn‚Äôt until I researched it until I found that the medication I‚Äôm on (Lamotrigine) becomes less effective when on hormonal birth control. My doctor didn‚Äôt tell me this, and when I brought it up he said it only affects the efficacy of birth control, which he didn‚Äôt bother telling me he thought that when he put me on it either.

I‚Äôve been trying to get an IUD for years but my doctor refused it because he says it‚Äôs usually only given to older women who‚Äôve had kids which is a completely outdated practice. I want a non hormonal birth control method that doesn‚Äôt affect the efficacy of my meds is that too much to ask??? Anyway, I finally got a consultation with a gynecologist for the copper IUD but it‚Äôs A FOUR MONTH WAIT. I couldn‚Äôt get an appointment until November which is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm going back to college in September after having to take mental health leave in the winter term because of a severe depressive episode, and I would really like to find a balance of meds and a non hormonal birth control method before then but looks like that isn‚Äôt an option.

I know bipolar disorder in general is at risk for many other illnesses/disorders as well as many other disorders often have multiple comorbidities. But for some reason I can‚Äôt get that fact out of my head. Bipolar disorder is enough lol and the thought of being 3x more likely to develop Alzheimer‚Äôs is just flat out scary.,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/ym86jh/dementia_and_bipolar_disorder/,1667590605.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I‚Äôve been lashing out and fighting a lot with her. The agitation is worse at night and I walk around my apartment aimlessly until it‚Äôs bedtime. I feel like a dementia patient sundowning. My hypochondriac OCD is telling me I have dementia and that‚Äôs why my meds aren‚Äôt working. I just cant seem to calm this agitation down. I can‚Äôt take my PRN antipsychotic during the day because it‚Äôs too sedating and I have to be able to work. I‚Äôm out of PTO because I used the last of it from the beginning of this episode. I‚Äôve talked to my doc about it but she‚Äôs only willing to make minor changes to my meds. I‚Äôve been talking with my therapist too and she just tells me to talk to my doctor about it and go to the ER if I can‚Äôt keep myself safe.

1l095fd,Bipolar,Memory loss and bipolar disorder,"Hi everyone, 
First of all, sorry for any mistakes I may do. English isn't my first language. 
I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2, and luckily I got a ""light"" form according to my psychiatrist and doesn't need meds yet. I'm closely monitored tho.
Point is, I'm learning to manage everything, trying to understand the pre-hypomanic signals, trying not to fall too deeply when I'm depressed and it's going okay.
However, I feel I'm losing memory day by day, and it's crushing me. It's not just the chilhood one ; I really forgot maybe 85% of my life. It's making me feel a feeling of sadness and desesperation so deep because I feel like I don't have any happy memories to make me feel alive, or just enjoy. I forgot vacations, parties, importants moments, what I did during months of my life... For example, I shared my life with a man I cared about deeply for 3 years, and can remember less than 10 memories with him. It's truly awful.
Have yall experimenting the same thing ? Does it come back at any point with therapy or sum ? How can I live with it ? It's also giving me so much anxiety bc I'm alway fearing it's signs of early dementia or another desease, eventho my psychiatrist said it's not related.

since then i feel like my mind is slipping away and i don't know how to solve it. i can't hold any information in my mind and i feel so stupid. i have really important events comming up related to my professional life so i really need to get better. i've searched here and many of you seemed to have similar problems after strong episodes. to those of you who were able to solve it, how did you do it? tips would be really appreciated. i'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1k41dzm/tips_to_reverse_memory_loss/,1745197544.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1l173zr,Bipolar,Memory loss and shame,"I was diagnosed with early onset when I was five years old and medicated for bipolar from age 6. When I was 22 I had a a manic episode because I went cold turkey off my medicine that I had been on since I was a child, this came with psychosis that landed me a 5 month grippy sock vacation back in 2022. One of the hardest things is when you come out of it, you really remember nothing that happened. I scared everybody in my life because of erratic and disorganized messages I thought were coming from a higher power. I did so many embarrassing things. While it is great to not remember these things, it is humiliating because everybody around me remembers. I will sometimes stumble upon an old text message chat and seeing some of the things I was saying makes me feel so ashamed and embarrassed because I sound absolutely insane. It is so hard to explain things that I do not even remember happening. Accidently stumbling upon an old message chain and seeing how confused everybody was is just so jarring.

I am med compliant, work out 5 days a week, have a steady income, graduated college with honors and am currently completing my masters degree. I am very stable and nobody would know that I have Bipolar. I just wish I had never gone off my medicine because the pain that it caused and the time it took me to get back to baseline was awful.

While there may be no quantifiable link between serotonin and mood, do you wanna know what serotonin is *definitely* linked to? LSD.

Do you wanna know what has wildly unpredictable and polar-opposite effects on mood, depending on un-quantifiable underlying psychological factors?

LSD and SSRIs.

Its seems that, by changing ones mental configuration, the placebo effect does the rest. If the placebo effect is powerful in physical illness, it appears at least doubly so in mental illness. This little caveat has been (for decades) and continues to be exploited by Big Pharma for profit, bringing about the generational pseudo-science of psychiatry -- an ultimately illogical and demonstrably un-scientific house of cards that will be looked upon by more advanced generations as having as much legitimacy as phrenology or astrology. 

For better or worse, the primacy of the Mind and its vast potential for self-definition as a sovereign entity, outside the stifling and nonsensical bounds of ""chemical balance,"" reclaims its throne.

Quotes from the article:

""The major new umbrella review ‚Äì an overview of existing meta-analyses and systematic reviews ‚Äì was published on July 20 in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. It suggests that depression is not likely caused by a chemical imbalance, and calls into question what antidepressant medications do.""

My son was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis/pancolitis in January and spent a month in the hospital. His fecal calprotectin was over 8,000, and he was just days away from needing his colon removed. He was started on Rinvoq, and almost immediately, his labs began to improve. He was able to go home, but shortly after developed a perianal abscess that turned into a fistula. After undergoing a few seton placements and adding Stelara to his treatment plan, things began to turn around.

He has since gained back nearly all of the 30 pounds he lost, works out five times a week, and is truly living life again. Yesterday, we received incredible news: his fecal calprotectin is now 45 ‚Äî back in the normal range ‚Äî and he is in clinical remission.

We‚Äôre celebrating this milestone and are hopeful for endoscopic remission during his next colonoscopy in December. To anyone going through this: don‚Äôt give up hope.

1c8ifqv,UlcerativeColitis,Q&A with a scientist on intestinal immunology and IBD,"Im a scientist that studies intestinal immunology and IBD. Throughout my career I have published a number of high impact papers in the top peer reviewed medical journals. I was diagnosed in college with IBD and have made it my life goal to understand the mechanisms behind this disease, to discover better treatments, and educate others. Unfortunately, most doctors do not receive the immunology training necessary to understand the complex mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases. This is very important for determining how to treat this disease. I believe as a patient educating yourself as much as possible about this disease is important in protecting yourself. I would like to take the time to answer any questions anyone has about the disease or the current treatments which are out there and what is next on the horizon. I will do my best to summarize the current literature and thinking.  

First my take on IBD. IBD is a loss of tolerance to the microbiota where the host immune response recognizes the commensal microbes as harmful and mounts the wrong type of immune response which leads to tissue damage. The mechanisms of everyones IBD is unique, but the pathology is what is common. Your genetic makeup coupled with the specific microbes in your microbiota skew each persons immune response differently. The drugs which work the best to treat the disease block key pathways which can lead to inflammation and tissue destruction: TNF (cell death), IL12p40 (Th1, Th17 responses), a4b7 (leukocyte trafficking to the intestine), Jak/Stat (common-y chain cytokines). Most patients fail these drugs over time because these drugs suppress one pathway without controlling what triggers the disease- restoring the barrier to the microbiota. We see this all the time in the laboratory when you neutralize one immune pathway something else compensates. 

The most important thing to do is limit inflammation and tissue destruction as fast as possible. Every 6-8 hours a CD8 T cell divides, every 12-24 hours a CD4 T cell divides. That is if you have a flair Friday night and your Dr. won't respond to you until Monday morning there can be expansion of thousands of autoreactive lymphocytes in that time. Tissue resident lymphocytes can persist for decades and we don't have a way to eliminate these cells from the repertoire. This disease doesn't work Mon-Frid 9-5pm. Its all the time and you need to be vigilant about your symptoms.

Don't be afraid of the word biologic or worried to start this line of treatment. These drugs are specific and in the case of Entyvio have been shown to be very safe in clinical trials. The most important is to limit inflammation and the faster you do that the better you will be in the long term. Treating the disease upfront aggressively is what is becoming the gold standard to promote tissue healing quickly. Limiting inflammation prevents fibrosis formation, decreases the risk of colorectal cancer, and prevents expansion of autoreactive cells and epitope spreading. 

Please let me know if there are any questions I can help with. Best of luck to you all. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1c8ifqv/qa_with_a_scientist_on_intestinal_immunology_and/,1713591779.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

1m86xnq,UlcerativeColitis,Crohns/ ulcerative colitis HELP,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm feeling really overwhelmed and hoping to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar.
Back in March, I had some constipation and bloating. My GP gave me laxatives and everything resolved quickly. Fast forward to early July I had one bowel movement with mucus and visible blood. Mucus remained for a few days after but only once had there been blood in bowl.
I saw whichever GP was available that day, and they prescribed laxatives. I pushed for a colonoscopy, which was booked the following week.
Colonoscopy findings:
-Mayo 1/ mild ulcerative colitis
-25 cm of continuous inflammation starting from the rectum
-One isolated per-appendiceal patch
-No granulomas
-Normal small bowel
I waited a month unmedicated for biopsy results. Today, the gastroenterologist reviewed it and diagnosed Crohn‚Äôs disease even though the report says mild UC. She prescribed prednisolone 50mg starting immediately with a taper (about 9 weeks total), and said I‚Äôll need immunosuppressants and biologics next.
She didn‚Äôt mention mesalazine (Pentasa) at all, nor did she explain clearly why she believes it‚Äôs Crohn‚Äôs instead of UC, especially when the colonoscopy didn‚Äôt show clear Crohn‚Äôs markers (skip lesions, granulomas, small bowel disease).
Oddly enough Tonight (a few hours after my appointment strangely at 7:38pm even though the clinic closes at 4pm), she called to say 50mg was too high, and I should actually start at 40mg instead. I had already questioned the dose earlier in the day.

My questions:
Is it normal to skip mesalazine and jump straight to steroids/ followed by immunosuppressants for mild inflammation?
Why the urgency to label this as Crohn‚Äôs so quickly?
What difference would 10mg of prednisolone really make in mild disease?
Should I be getting a second opinion before committing to such an aggressive treatment path?

If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have advice, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what‚Äôs actually best for my body before going down a serious treatment path.

1h3foob,UlcerativeColitis,Apparently I have Crohn's now?,"QUICK BIO: Was first diagnosed with UC in 2015. Was fairly moderate until 2020, when worsening symptoms led me to starting infusions of Inflectra. Was on that steady for nearly three years until my GI took me off of it because my inflammation markers still weren't looking good enough. I was on zero medication from Jan to July this year when I was hospitalized for just over a week with my first ever real flare up. They put me back on Inflectra and started me on a Prednisone taper from 40mg. Every two weeks, down 5mgs. I just finished this taper a couple of weeks ago, and started to flare again last week.

CURRENTLY: Got transferred to Calgary this Tuesday. Found out I have C Diff. Yesterday I was scoped from gums to bum and also had a pelvic MRI done.

Doctor comes in this morning and tells me because of the symptoms and long-standing perianal issues (2x fistula w/ abscesses - currently have a seton band keeping one open) that I definitively have Crohn's.

What a whirlwind. I'm exhausted.

ACTUAL Q: Has anyone else had their diagnosis switched after many years of being treated for and told one thing? If so, what was that experience like for you??

I collected donations for a couple months, then my beautiful wife (and caregiver in flares) and I went to the event. The walk itself was short, but it was the ceremony before that made all the difference in the world. I had previously thought that I was too whiny about my UC. It couldn't be that bad, I'm just a wimp. (Personal thoughts, maybe enhanced by parents but not the wife) But getting to hear speeches from other patients and see the sheer amount of us who had collected money and came out for this made me feel like I am giving my disease the appropriate amount of attention. It is a big thing. I'm not alone in feeling that way.  

We all wrote on a ribbon why we were taking Steps that day. Then they tied the ribbons onto ropes that lined the finish line area. They had us put our names on sticky flags and put them on a big cartoon map with places like mount remission (where I'm happy my flag went) and other themes.

125j6ar,UlcerativeColitis,biggest mistake i made with ulcerative colitis,"stats: 40, male, 5'9"", \~200 pounds, diagnosed mid-2004, have used prednisone, asacol, imuran, remicade, entyvio, simponi, humira, enemas, etc... i'm now using xeljanz.

the biggest mistake i made (until the past six years) in my history of ulcerative colitis was relying almost entirely on medications to provide me with remission in the absence of lifestyle management. in other words, i didn't meaningfully explore manipulation of lifestyle variables (particularly around food/nutrition -- types of foods, volumes, timing, time-restricted eating/fasting) due to my false belief that my disease's symptoms were independent of how i lived my life.

i have a severe case of ulcerative colitis, which was worsened by my own self-induced physical degradation over time due to my own negligence. thankfully, about six years ago i began to reverse course with respect to exploring/discovering how different lifestyle variables affect (or don't) my disease activity.

at my worst, i was 265 (very fat, overweight), resigned to ongoing degeneration, and almost accepted a colectomy. thank god i eventually hit a 'rock bottom' inflection point of resisting what i thought was inevitable.

TL;DR -- do not simply depend on medications and wait for relief -- use them as bridges to explore and discover how nutrition, exercise, sleep, etc can further induce and sustain remissions; and conversely, what you may do doing or missing that induces flare-ups.

1knuy7f,UlcerativeColitis,Is Ulcerative Colitis curable? My sibling is struggling and we‚Äôre shattered.,"Hi everyone,

This has been such a difficult time for our family, and I‚Äôm reaching out in hope of some guidance or support.

My sibling has been recently diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, and for the past month, she has been going to the washroom 6-8 times a day. Initially, we didn‚Äôt understand what was happening  we consulted multiple doctors. First allopathic treatment, then a gastroenterologist, and later even Yunani medicine. She also had blood tests, a CRP test, and a stool test done.
The results were mostly normal, except that she was anemic, had low hemoglobin, and there was a parasitic infection along with blood in her stool.

She often feels nauseous after eating, or needs to go to the toilet within an hour of eating anything. We switched to a strict diet :::: 
 giving her only boiled apples, rice, and easily digestible food. With that, her condition improved. She was going to the washroom only 1-3 times a day with normal stool. We felt hopeful.

But just yesterday, we gave her paneer (Indian cottage cheese, similar to tofu but made from milk) and she immediately relapsed,  4‚Äì6 washroom trips, watery stool, and fatigue.

We‚Äôre heartbroken. She hasn‚Äôt stepped out of the house or met her close friends in over 4 months. She‚Äôs become very withdrawn and scared to eat anything due to fear of needing the toilet afterward. Her weight dropped from 56 kg to 49 kg.
We‚Äôve tried everything we could  all forms of medicine, diet changes, emotional support  but we don‚Äôt know what else to do.

Is there anyone else going through something similar?

Is UC permanent, or can it truly be healed or managed long-term?

What diets have helped you or your loved ones?

What‚Äôs the best way to avoid flare-ups?


We‚Äôre emotionally and mentally exhausted, and any help or shared experience would mean the world to us.

1lrzrhe,UlcerativeColitis,Wife is desensitised to my Ulcerative Colitis,"I‚Äôve been with my wife for 15 years. I could diagnosed with ulcerative colitis after a year of being together. My wife and I have been together since we were both 19 and got diagnosed at 20. She was an amazing support through the first period of being diagnosed. She is a wonderful woman and I love her dearly.  

Fast forward to today and we have a 5 month old and a marriage that is crumbling to bits. I‚Äôm in my first active flare up in about 8 years after Infliximab decided it didn‚Äôt want to work anymore. It was amazing for those 8 years. I‚Äôm now on Stelara, but it‚Äôs doing nothing. Starting prednisone today to try and get it under a bit of control. 

I want to make it clear that I‚Äôm far from a perfect person or husband. I have many flaws that I‚Äôve tried to work on with a psychologist and psychiatrist to some avail. But because it‚Äôs been a solid 8 years since I have been in bad shape the past month or so and our lives are completely different, but it seems my wife just doesn‚Äôt quite understand what it‚Äôs like living this life. Constant abdominal pain, mucus/blood every since time you go the toilet, the muscle and joint pain and of course the deterioration of mental health. She is somewhat empathetic, but it seems as though she doesn‚Äôt have the concern she once did for me. Of course it isn‚Äôt solely the UC, but a combination of many factors, including the general natural attrition of being together half our lives. I seem to think having a baby has shifted so much of her capacity to love and care for him and somewhat neglects myself. I know that sounds selfish, but I think it‚Äôs the case. 

I‚Äôm unsure where to go from here. But it now seems more likely than not, that we will end up in a divorce. Which 12 months ago, I would have laughed at anyone that would have suggested we‚Äôd get divorced. We have been together for essentially our whole adult lives. 

Unsure what my point of this rant was. I think I‚Äôm just so emotionally charged and need to communicate with people that actually understand how our daily lives operate. 

Any support/advice and criticisms are welcome. I need here all points of view.

1ereb9c,UlcerativeColitis,Root Causes of Ulcerative Colitis,"I‚Äôm making this because I have been living with Pan. UC for 13 years and I would like help/ideas from others who share a similar story. I want help/ideas of what the root cause of this disease actually is. There are various stories of people getting diagnosed with this and although it‚Äôs a person by person specific disease I can‚Äôt help but think there has to be some of us out there that have a very close idea or theory of the science/biology behind the contraction of this mysterious autoimmune disease. Idc if we aren‚Äôt doctors, I think people sharing their experiences/ideas with this disease and brainstorming this topic is very important. I‚Äôll go first!

Before I was diagnosed at 18 (currently 30) weeks had not food allergies or intolerance. I ate the standard American/Western diet meaning I was eating nothing but processed bs every meal even with veggies. I had very stressful/traumatic childhood until 15 so if this disease is caused by trauma or stress like some claim then idk why I didn‚Äôt developed this sooner? Especially with the diet I just told yall about. The only other thing that I can think may have caused this disease is me ignorantly abusing ibuprofen/advil. And I really think for my case that was the main cause, I would get debilitating migraines ever since I could remember and the only thing that would stop the pain was Ibuprofen/advil. For those who don‚Äôt know ibuprofen/advil will eat away at the you stomach and intestinal linings. I haven‚Äôt taken Advil in over a decade. So that was mine, hopefully others will join and help me brainstorm.

TLDR: THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM UC TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK IS THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF THIS MYSTERIOUS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE!

1m3pp8n,UlcerativeColitis,Remission is Possible - What I Learned After 20 Years with Ulcerative Colitis,"I‚Äôve had ulcerative colitis since I was 24‚ÄîI'm now 44‚Äîand I‚Äôve been in remission for the past 10 years. I was initially prescribed Salofalk (Mesalazine), but it didn‚Äôt work for me. These days, I manage my UC with Imuran(Azathioprine) an immunosuppressant, a restricted diet, and regular exercise. 

A bit of backstory: when I was first diagnosed, I had just started my career as a city bus operator. Needless to say, it was a nightmare. I often experienced urgency while driving a packed bus, and there were more than a few close calls where I nearly soiled myself on the job. It was humiliating, stressful, and physically exhausting.

I‚Äôve dealt with the full range of UC symptoms, such as severe bleeding, drastic weight loss, and multiple hospital stays. Things really changed for me when I started having kids. That gave me a bigger reason to get better, not just for myself but for them. One way I managed UC at work was by using the washroom at every possible opportunity, even when I didn‚Äôt feel the urge.

So, I began tracking everything, what I ate and how I felt afterward. I kept a detailed log of symptoms ranging from mild to severe: abdominal cramping, black or foul-smelling stool, excess gas (farting / burping), urgency, blood in the stool, and how often I was going to the washroom (which used to be 4 to 10 times a day). Alongside that, I logged exactly what I was eating each day.

I used a trial-and-error method, starting by eating freely, then removing foods one by one to see which ones triggered flare-ups. If you want to try something similar, you could either start this way or take a stricter approach: stick to only ‚Äòsafe‚Äô foods first, and gradually reintroduce others to identify your triggers.

For me, foods high in potassium seemed to be a problem, bananas, avocados, and salmon all triggered symptoms. Dairy was another major issue: milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, and cream cheese were all off-limits. Fried foods, heavily spiced meals or specific spices, beer, and alcohol also made the list. But keep in mind: your list might look completely different, which is why personal tracking is so important.

To this day, I‚Äôm still on an immunosuppressant (Imuran), which is definitely keeping my condition in check, but combining that with a disciplined diet and exercise routine has kept me in remission. If you feel like you‚Äôve tried everything and nothing's working, this might be a path worth exploring.

Be patient, it‚Äôs a slow, frustrating process, and you might not see instant results. Some foods that trigger symptoms can take a while to show their effects, which is why the symptom log is so important. Even something subtle like excessive gas or foul-smelling stool can be a clue that your gut isn‚Äôt agreeing with something you're eating.

Now at 44, with four beautiful kids, still working my city job, and able to take vacations and road trips whenever and wherever I choose, I‚Äôm truly grateful I never gave up on myself. UC tried to control my life, but I took that control back. It wasn‚Äôt easy, and it won‚Äôt be perfect, but healing is possible. Stay curious, stay determined, and don‚Äôt lose hope. You‚Äôve got this.

Wishing you strength, healing, and all the best on your journey.

I am absolutely baffled that anyone in this world would think that I would want to be absolutely sedated just for fun. Panic attacks are god awful. 

It‚Äôs hard enough accepting that I need a biologic to treat my ulcerative colitis. The last thing I need is a nurse refusing to help me get the medication I need and projecting her own values and experiences onto me.

But rant off - have any of you tried any of the fast-acting anxiety meds like lorazepam or the beta blockers to help with this? I was on lexapro for a long time after my diagnosis and figuring out I needed some support but I hated how flat it made me feel.

u4d19r,UlcerativeColitis,"Bloodwork giving me panic attacks, I'm terrified of PSC.","This post is more for me writing out how I feel, rather than looking for answers, but I'd appreciate some insight from people who have experience with this stuff.
So my UC was diagnosed 3 years ago, I've been kind of fine with 3g Salofalk (mesalazine) up until a few months ago when I started having bad flare ups. Around 6 weeks ago I went to my GI told him my symptoms are bad so he prescribed Pentasa 4g (also mesalazine, just higher dosage) and ordered a blood test. I've been on the Pentasa for 3 weeks, my symptoms improved greatly,  I feel fine. Then I went for the blood test, which was all good except for the liver panel stuff. My ALP and GGT are now 3x the maximum reference value, the other 2 are slightly higher than the max. Bilirubin is normal.

I'm getting an MRCP next week because my GI suspects PSC (Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis) and I'm freaking out over that. I haven't slept in 2 days, and I'm going to go crazy because I'll only get the results a week after the MRCP. So I have like 10 days of going crazy left.

I don't have any symptoms of liver issues, no jaundice, no yellowing, no dark urine, no pale stools, no pain. But those values seem really high and I've been googling what they could mean (i know, not the best thing to do) and I always end up at PSC. The reason that scares me so much is that I read that it eventually requires a liver transplant, which is extremely hard to get in my country.

Anyone ever had liver enzymes so high and maybe not get diagnosed with PSC?

1ltdifu,UlcerativeColitis,This disease is so stressed related (for me),"Obviously having no stress cannot ‚Äúcure‚Äù this disease. But holy shit, I think I just figured out what causes my flares. 
I was diagnosed after a terrible breakup about 5 years ago, super stressed, working a rough manual labor job, never really thought anything about stress triggering the flare, was put on mesalamine and I was fine for a few years.
Fast forward a few years, new job, better money, incredible stress, mesalamine stopped working and was put on a biologic. That helped reduce the symptoms of the flare, but I was still in a flare. 

Long story short, with the tough job I do get blessed with a lot of vacation time. 
Took a vacation a month ago, basically zero symptoms while overseas, just pure good fun. I get back from this vacation three weeks ago, MEGA FLARE started. 
Went from 1 time a day to 10 just like that. 
The symptoms slowly got a bit better, probubly 3-4 times a day and then last week I left for another vacation. 
Now I feel amazing, almost like I‚Äôm in remission, going 1-2 times a day, minimal urgency.

I know I‚Äôm probubly not in remission, but this is such a good feeling. I know I need to work on stress management now, this has been one of the most stress free summers of my life, and my symptoms have been so good while I haven‚Äôt been stressed. 


I don‚Äôt want to quit this job but I really think I have too at some point because the stress that it brings is definitely not contributing in a good way to my health. 

I just wanted to share my recent experience and see if anyone can relate. 
Hopefully I can get into real remission soon, I really think if I can keep my stress levels down, I will get there. But something tells me on Monday morning I‚Äôll be back in the flare.

am I right they are saying it's a chronic form of procitis and not acute?

They took samples of my whole colon not just the rectum, they said I'd receive the results in a few weeks so surprised so quick.

Or am I reading this wrong?

It goes on to say to carry on my anema of 2 g at night and supositry of 1g in morning for another month.

Then GP to resubpeescribe 1g supositry after 4 weeks if symptoms don't stop after medication.

1. I'm terrified I'm now going to rapidly develop full blown colitis and need a transplant, have osteoporosis and my life is over , like I feel it's a matter of time before my procitis decides to spread.

2. I have a fatty liver so I'm concerned about any meds making it worse? I've seen Meslazimine can agitate the liver? 

3. I'm now scared to eat anything considered a treat....my doctor told me I can eat treats if they agree with me but have a balanced diet so obviously not junk food usually but healthy foods most of the time...

I have health anxiety and OCD which doesn't help with the uncertainty this disease brings....and I genuinely am scared :(

Can anyone offer any insight or support.

1h2vol6,UlcerativeColitis,"Feeling scared and depressed, not sure how to cope ","I just got a prelim diagnosis of UC last night in the ER from a CT scan. Haven't seen a GI doc or had a colonoscopy yet. I've had bad / urgent diarrhea & bloody stool daily, multiple times a day for a few months & worsening symptoms of anemia for the past few weeks, prompting me to go to urgent care and then the ER, based on urgent care's recommendation. I let it go for so long because I honestly thought it was just because of a shitty diet and a bad hemmroid that I couldn't stop itching. 

At first, I was just relieved to have some sort of diagnosis because I have been pretty miserable. Also relieved it wasn't cancer or something. But then I realized it was an autoimmune disease, chronic, lifelong. I looked at posts here where people have shared their experiences and debilitating symptoms, as far as having colon removed. Thinking about how miserable I've been the past few months and realizing I now just have to deal with these symptoms when I flare up, maybe forever :( realizing how actually serious this condition is. 

I've been prescribed prednisone for 20 days total, 40mg for first 5 days and then tapering down slowly. The horror stories I've read about its side effects freak me out so much. I already have anxiety/panic disorder with a healthy dose of being a hypochondriac terrified of all things medical and I am so scared that prednisone will affect me mentally bc I've heard it makes you anxious and jittery. 

I'm 31f and I've never had any health issues other than anemia which was treated successfully until this. No history of any IBD in my family. I've always been the type of person who rarely gets sick and haven't really had to deal with the world of hospitals or medications, so it just feels like a gut punch. 

I just can't stop crying. I went from healthy to now having a chronic autoimmune disease that I will have to treat for the rest of my life. If I end up on biologics, does this mean no longer going to concerts, festivals, out to crowded places because I will now be immunocompromised and it's just too risky in our COVID world? Am I now going to get sick much much more, and health complications down the road bc of UC and the drugs used to treat it? 

I know no one can answer these questions. I just feel....absolutely devastated and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. It feels so out of nowhere and unfair. Am I being over dramatic? I feel like I want to cease everything I can (social life etc) and just hide away. What's the point if I am going to be sick so often now. 

I'm so sorry if this comes off as whiny or poor me. I just feel absolutely terrified and depressed and I don't know anyone in my life who has a similar condition. Just a vent but if anyone is willing to share their experience of having similar (or different) feelings I would totally appreciate it.

1kn5vr2,UlcerativeColitis,"Recently diagnosed, depressed and not sure what should I now?","My symptoms started about a month ago with bleeding, horrid abdominal pain, and of course, weight loss, the classics. Fortunately, I managed to get diagnosed fairly quickly with UC (Pancolitis, moderate). I'm currently in my first week of treatment with mesalamine (4x a day) + Curcumin/Qing Dai supplement, and it's been working great: my symptoms disappeared almost two days after I started treatment. For the past three days, I‚Äôve been feeling like a normal person again, with normal stools, once a day. Worth mentioning: my calprotectin level was 3000 before diagnosis.

However, on the other side, I‚Äôm feeling lost. I‚Äôve been following a super restrictive diet containing only chicken breast, eggs, white toasted bread, and rice. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôd rather not eat than force down the same four ingredients I was told are safe. I‚Äôm getting depressed thinking this might be my life from now on. Before this, I was a big fan of going out, eating out, enjoying a glass of wine - Is all that gone forever? Everything I read seems to contradict itself, but diet still appears to play a huge role in managing UC and seems to remain quite restrictive even for people in remission. 

What I‚Äôm not sure about is what to do now. From what I understand, remission means calprotectin levels under 50. Does that mean I‚Äôm only allowed to eat these 4 ingredients until I hit that number? Only¬†*then*¬†can I start reintroducing foods slowly while keeping a food journal? I‚Äôve read that it can take 4‚Äì6 weeks for calprotectin levels to normalize, but that feels like an eternity on this diet. The whole thing is driving me insane. I feel like there‚Äôs not much left to enjoy, not even a coffee for the moment.

I‚Äôd be really interested to hear your views and experiences. How has your journey been in terms of¬†**diet, alcohol, and getting back to living normally**?

Nothing I can do, insurance won‚Äôt change it to Lialda brand name. Suggestions for relief?","TLDR; mid-moderate/severe flair, new pancolitis diagnosis (suddenly up from formerly well-managed proctitis), taking mesalamine oral tablets delayed-release for first time. = SUCKS. Skip ahead 2 paragraphs. 

Currently in my fourth week of a 40 mg prednisone taper plus Mesalamine 4.8 g oral tablet flare dosage when I‚Äôve never used the tablets in my life (most days can only handle 3 pills (3.6 g) unfortunately, I used to only use enemas and suppositories for my mild proctitis and a little bit of left-side that was all well-managed and mild for the most part since my diagnosis five years ago. Now I‚Äôve had to add the oral and it‚Äôs a f*cking trip.

I‚Äôm in a stressful lifestyle and it caught up with me, and at the same time I got exposed to natural gas from an unlit pilot light for two days that wrecked my upper G.I., which I previously had no issues with, and which everyone tries to tell you clears up for people as soon as you‚Äôre out of the gas environment‚Ä¶. Yeah,  maybe everyone without an IBD that is. Even my doctor says that raised my liver enzymes and it prob triggered this major gastritis for me. Confirmed case with endoscopy. Also on a PPI for that now. Plus she thinks I‚Äôm having underlying IBS as well and thought that before the natural gas exposure. This wouldn‚Äôt surprise me, my mother has Alzheimer‚Äôs. That whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stress out‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt really work for me. (Currently trying to eat low FODMAP and doing the Nerva app for the possible IBS.)

SO: Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know what side effects are coming from the prednisone and what are coming from the Mesalamine, but both are absolute shit on my body and I have to space them all out throughout the day. So aside from the normal stuff one would expect from a high dosage of steroids, I have isolated these bonus features of this lovely mesalamine generic delayed-release oral tablets (orangish-red horse pill) formulation:

Each time I take my mesalamine oral delayed release, within 45 mins-1.5 hours after taking it is when the tightness in my upper G.I. starts, the tightness / pressure / pain in my mid-low back and spine starts, and, numb, achy feelings in my quads, shins and top of my feet that make me feel paralyzed and unable to lift my legs to even go upstairs. Definitely can‚Äôt get myself up off the floor without pulling on something with my arms. The intense eyeball pressure is also definitely directly related to those pills. My eyes bug out and feel dry and painful. I often feel like I‚Äôm straight tripping. And my body feels absolutely caught in a tranquilizer paralysis. Swollen throat, a little bit too, sometimes constriction in my chest feeling. It‚Äôs all very scary and I‚Äôm supposed to do it four times a day with these pills! Lucky if I get to three. And I know I need the medicine to get out of the flare. So anyway, these are the side effects that I have isolated from the steroid responses because both of them give me tons of facial sinus pressure and weird body feelings and fatigue and a face that feels like it‚Äôs being rearranged, as if my teeth are moving all over the place, and of course the pred also gives me racing heart and only 2-3 hours of hodge-podged sleep every 24 hours even though I‚Äôm currently totally homebound and able to if I could. 
‚Äã ‚Äã
So two different pharmacists have told me that these responses to Mesalamine are not normal. I‚Äôve also told them about Reddit and how common it is to hear that you just have to change up the formulation and find the one that works for you. Well, obviously doctors are skeptical about everything we learn on Reddit so that angle isn‚Äôt going well, but they did try to send in a prescription for the brand name Lialda for me to try instead. Only problem is, insurance refuses to pay for it. So now doctor is thinking I should probably want to try biologics (says mesalamine isn‚Äôt that effective anyway?!). I do not want to just casually skip to biologics if a different formulation of mesalamine oral could work for me. I‚Äôm not against them, but come on, there‚Äôs a more straightforward solution to this. Be real. Like, this is worth switching insurance for me. Mesalamine suppositories and enemas worked great for me, there‚Äôs no reason why an oral version shouldn‚Äôt, I feel like just need to find the right one, based on all of your posts and comments. And the mes IS helping, by the way, like I‚Äôm just suffering through these weird side effects but I am still improving my colitis for sure. Even without the full dosage. But prior authorization for the new pills didn‚Äôt work and now my doctor is trying to do the P2P peer review, but I can tell her heart isn‚Äôt in it. She referred me to a rheumatologist for these symptoms because she doesn‚Äôt seem to believe that it‚Äôs directly related to the pills, she also talked about systemic issues from the UC itself, and she told me I‚Äôm having anxiety. üòÜ Yeah, no shit, cause you‚Äôve been taking every holiday and vacation and never calling me back in a timely manner this entire time and making errors like not even telling me I was supposed to start the mesalamine oral for five days until my pharmacist called and was like ‚Äúdo you want this medicine or not?‚Äù Not to mention every LabCorp employee that I came into contact with (4) during the testing phase had given me the wrong number of stool samples or the wrong kind of containers and delayed my progress there as well. I‚Äôm completely traumatized by the fragmented American healthcare system, which is so different than what I experienced in Germany when I got my diagnosis and had all the labs and answers done within a couple days in the doctor‚Äôs very own freaking office. [Like, you guys, I walked into my German doctor the first time and he did a freaking ultrasound himself to check inflammation right then and there in the office. Then he scheduled me a colonoscopy (in the room next door) for a few days later while I started the prep. Within a week I had my UC diagnosis and my little enemas and suppositories and I fixed that shit immediately. Can you imagine?!]

So TLDR again;

ANYTHING you‚Äôve found to help with any of these weird side effects? Yes I eat with every single pill, and the Mesalamine always get like a whole meal.

TIA! üôè

m2uc7z,UlcerativeColitis,If you ever wondered how much CBD you *might* need to help control UC ...,"[https://jagwire.augusta.edu/cbd-reduces-plaque-improves-cognition-in-model-of-familial-alzheimers/](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/cbd-reduces-plaque-improves-cognition-in-model-of-familial-alzheimers/)

&#x200B;

Yeah, it's an article about Alzheimer's and CBD, but there's a pretty important point buried in the article.

&#x200B;

\> The investigators report for the first time that CBD normalizes levels and function, improving cognition as it also reduces levels of the immune protein IL-6, which is associated with the high inflammation levels found in Alzheimer‚Äôs 

&#x200B;

IL-6 is also one of the key cytokines associated with UC inflammation.  If you assume the model they used in this study has some application for UC, that is the level  of IL-6 reduction needed to see improvements in Alzheimer's is similar to the reduction needed for UC improvements, you're looking at  10mg/kg per day.  That's \~800-850mg per day for an average adult male. That's a lot of CBD, y'all.  If anyone is trying to treat their UC with CBD, this \*might\* be an indication of the levels you'll need to see therapeutic results, but as always, YMMV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/m2uc7z/if_you_ever_wondered_how_much_cbd_you_might_need/,1615480486.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
84dhp9,UlcerativeColitis,I know this is contrary to everything we‚Äôre told to do but I just went plant based/vegan. I‚Äôm doing so much better!,"My UC has been pretty bad. I‚Äôm on Entyvio every 4 weeks and usually get sick around day 25 then take another 5 days after the infusion to recover. All the prednisone I‚Äôve been on has given me a big belly which is just an inflammation machine. On top of that I have fibromyalgia and get psoriasis when I flare up.  When I told my gastro I was going to do this she looked at me like I was absolutely nuts. 

Because prednisone and another medication, and avoiding lots of fiber has made me borderline diabetic. That‚Äôs all about inflammation. On top of that my dad passed away in November from Alzheimer‚Äôs and that disease is all about, you got it, inflammation. Being diabetic and being at a higher risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs anyway would all but assure I‚Äôd end up with it. Just the thought of dealing with UC and fibro while my mind slips away was more than I could handle. 

My sister has been vegan for years and kept telling me that‚Äôs what I needed to do. I kept telling that‚Äôs I‚Äôd end up in the ER.  I didn‚Äôt. In fact, my colon has been improving! Crazy, I know. 

I‚Äôm doing this gently. I‚Äôm not sitting down to huge kale salads filled with beans. I know I‚Äôm soy intolerant. It‚Äôs actually really hard to digest so no tofu for me. There‚Äôs lots of soups, smoothies and sweet potatoes. My Vitamix gets a workout! I also eat lots of miso soup  with with cooked veggie and ramen noodles. I‚Äôm fine with fermented soy and it has good probiotics in it. All fermented foods do so I try to get some every day. Eating sauerkraut and kimchi seem scary but I‚Äôve always seen improvement after eating small amounts of them long before this vegan experiment.   

I do eat some white flour and white rice some days to balance out the fiber intake.  But now I‚Äôm able to eat some raw fruit and veggies. I like to sprout my beans a little to make them easier to digest. Baked apples are my friends. I put oats in the center with some spices, never my trigger food cinnamon. Both have gentle water soluble fiber. There are ways to do this in a more UC friendly way. For me that doesn‚Äôt mean loading up Oreos or vegan ice cream. Little treats now and then are good. 

This all makes sense because so much of UC is an imbalance in the gut flora and reducing inflammation. Eating plant based is killing off the bad bacteria and allowing the good ones to flourish. The more I win the bacteria war the better my colon does. 

Not only is my colon doing better, I‚Äôm doing better. Lowering my intake of all the healthy foods I‚Äôve avoided was making tired and undernourished. I have more energy. Kale juice has more iron than meat. I put it in my smoothies because, honestly, it tastes gross. 

I know this probably isn‚Äôt for everyone. I know that I‚Äôll have to adjust if I have a flare and eat some meat, eggs and fish. I just wanted to let everyone know this least probable path to remission is possible. It‚Äôs been about six weeks and my prednisone belly is starting so go down and other signs of inflammation are also reversing. I‚Äôm more hopeful now than I‚Äôve been in years.

1lltixv,UlcerativeColitis,How do you guys manage work?,"I‚Äôm supposed to go back to work soon, but I just feel so tired and sick. I work at a bakery, and agreed to go back because my parents are really pestering I find an actual income which is fair. I only work as a bakery clerk though so I mean heavy lifting and stuff is still present but not worryingly. The shift is 8 hours on your feet though. 

The doctors are worried it‚Äôs coming back worse again, and are putting me back on steroids which is most definitely going to screw me over like they did last time especially mentally. They‚Äôre also doubling my dose of Entivo which I hope won‚Äôt have any side effects. 

Then I‚Äôm trying to sign up for college, I‚Äôve given up on perusing nursing it costs too much and with my health it‚Äôs just not realistic or stable. So I have to find something in college this week to get me a stable career that might work well with my health, I need to take 3 classes to keep my healthcare.

I‚Äôve also been stripped off my anti depressants recently due to a random and severe case of seratonion syndrome that almost killed me. I feel absolutely horrible mentally now, I‚Äôm quite literally seeing/hearing things that aren‚Äôt there. And my pelvic pain is horrible, but no ultrasounds show anything. My birth control isn‚Äôt working at all and I have no idea why.
And I‚Äôm worried because my chest is straining and I‚Äôve had a few episodes where my heart rate spikes up to nearly 200 for no reason so I hope it‚Äôs nothing like that again.

Overall now I eat less than 1000 calories a day, my weight is overall pretty fine. If I eat too much I‚Äôll vomit and my stomach pain will interfere. On working days I won‚Äôt eat anything at all, if they‚Äôre back to back then maybe something small. Ive trained myself to walk 10k steps without using the bathroom by not eating. So I can still hangout with friends, masking the pain is easier now. 

I feel like I‚Äôve given up all my dreams, barely living. All my tests come back normal, they have no idea whats wrong with me half the time. They just rule it down to stress. The ER can‚Äôt do anything to help me. 

I‚Äôm only 18 and my families health history is absolute garbage. Cancer, diabetes, heart issues, dementia etc‚Ä¶ It feels like no matter what happens I‚Äôll end up in the hospital miserable. 

I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll end back up in the hospital, this feels like a certain death trap at times. I‚Äôm tired of being a burden to my family. So how do you guys manage with your UC and work?

1j65ojn,UlcerativeColitis,Etiquette on hospital wards and general experience - UK,"Hello fellow poopers!

TL:DR: What are best practices to make time spent on hospital wards as stress free as possible regarding other patients.

Short time pooper (34M, diagnosed at 30), first time poster. I'm finding a lot of really helpful information in here and so pleased I've found a new resource for advice from a huge variety of experiences so thank you all for sharing so much. 

I won't go into my UC journey as I've already read my situation a few times here, but what I did want to discuss was general etiquette on wards while admitted. Apologies if this has been discussed ad infinitum. 

For context, this is my 2nd time in hospital with a severe flare up, the first being when I was diagnosed at London St George's who I must say, the team of nurses, doctors and specialists were amazing. Now after relocation I am at Bath Royal United Hospital for the first time. 

The procedure for both admitals has been identical in routine of:

1) Private room with loo post triage
2) Moved to a gastro ward private room with loo
3) After improvement, moved out into a bay on the ward 

What has stuck with me is that,  on the gastro wards there have always been patients with some sort of dementia or more elderly confused/fussy patients all linked to some sort of gastro illness. 

Medical staff have referred to me as a 'well' patient on both my stays - initially I thought they were being kind and supportive, though when mentioned to a group of medical friends and my sister-in-law who is a nurse, they informed me it's a common term used (which made me feel a bit silly like my gold star had been had been taken away). I definitely feel like a well and very lucky patient in comparison to those around me as I am compos mentis, independent mobility wise and suffer a much less life threatening illness from my perspective.

So when I see a confused or struggling neighbour needing help and nurses are absent I try and do what I can for them, which mostly consists of helping them find the 'call nurse' button. It could be me one day in that situation so I would hope another patient would do the same for me if they were able, but I wouldn't want to burden anyone but the staff there to treat me.

It's late evening and a few patients were brought back to their bays from various procedures. A neighbour began shouting at the glass window towards the nurses station for attention which started to cause me some anxiety for every other patient resting/sleeping. I asked if he was ok and I'll go and get the nurse for him. During the brief exchange I immediately became aware that he was hard of hearing, confused as to where I came from and not in a good mood. He grumbled back at me 'I don't want the nurse I want the doctor with my bloody X-Rays.'

I went to the nurses station out in the hall to avoid explaining his mental state and wants in front of said patient. The nurse knew who I was talking about with a knowing look of what's to come. When the nurse and I re-entered, I returned to my bed and the patient started asking in a belligerent manor that he wanted his X-Rays and eventually started shouting 'Why am I here now? I want my X-Rays' and so on. The nurse was very patient and explained it is late at night so he will have to wait til morning. Upon the nurse leaving, the patient began shouting again at the nurse through the window that he needed the bathroom. Fortunately the nurse was tuned in and returned to show the way. 

So the old chaps confused, deaf and irritable, good markers for some sort of serious illness and gets a pass for being a twat. Its not the first or last time I will see or hear this behaviour.

It's just dawned on me that my initial good deed could go punished as it could potentially make me a first port of call in the future with complaints or assistance. While I consider myself 'well', I am still here to get into remission as quickly as I can (and GTFO) without introducing more stressors and elongating my occupation of a bed. 

So my question is, what are your own best behaviours and practices you can implement on wards? 

I know I'll eventually get more experience and understanding in the future, however I am interested to know from others experiences and tactics used to keep stressors at bay and try and make the whole experience a bit more... pleasant... If that's possible.

Footnote A:
It took me a while to write this and I've reflected while editing, and my first conclusion is I should take a bit more time to assess my surroundings and use best judgement on who/what to engage with. And the second is to try and ignore my gut feeling of trying to help and be polite (which feels illegal being British and all) and just use my own call button and direct the nurses over to where they are needed. 

Footnote B:
As I writing Footnote A, my neighbour on the other side knocked his water jug all over his bed and is making a big song and dance that he just wants to go to sleep while the staff change his sheets...

1en1da5,UlcerativeColitis,Supplements or vitamins to compensate gaps in flare-save diet? ,"I am in flare but getting closer to remission. However, I am still constantly tired and my memory and concentration is getting so bad, so bad, it feels like dementia.

My mom is in my ears about getting the right vitamins, which ""surely I am not getting with the diet I have adopted to help with the UC"". I am still having meat sometimes but not often (and rarely red, simply because I don't know how to prep it) but am really every worse with the vegetables. Only thing I am having is bananas and cooked and peeled tomatoes from the tin. Most of my diet is rice (white rice pasta and rice wavers, and some tomato sauce with salt). I don't have the energy and time to cook/steam myself a more versatile vegetable mix. 

In terms of taking supplements to help with what's missing I have the weird fear that my GI tract won't like pills (probably because of the famous negative reactions to many iron supplements). Do you think its save to try? (i.e. what is your personal experience?) What would be your recommendations to help with energy and memory?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1en1da5/supplements_or_vitamins_to_compensate_gaps_in/,1723108610.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
sszf2t,UlcerativeColitis,"Stomach pain, fatigue, prednisone, enema etc.","Just had a colonoscopy and doctor briefly said that bowel inflammation was present but not in the rectum. This is probably because my enemas are working but not the prednisone or biological that I‚Äôm taking. It basically means I get severe stomach pains and fatigue, and every known symptom of prednisone (worst being temporary dementia), but I‚Äôm only going to the bathroom 2 times a day. Going to the bathroom regularly was terrible, but at least used to give a sense of relief to the rest of the pain I was experiencing. 

Anyway now I can go out in public and see people because the urgency isn‚Äôt there, but the fatigue, stomach pains and prednisone side effects make socialising/studying/working so difficult and unenjoyable I‚Äôve lost all will to do these things.

nrdcf4,UlcerativeColitis,Bothersome Bowels,"Apologies for the vague title of this post, can't seem to find another phrase that could make it less vague without going into gritty details, which I would prefer to do outside of a title! But to the point.

I'm in the process of being diagnosed with UC after years of symptoms (but only just going to the GP as I've had other health episodes that I prioritised), and the doctors I've seen are quite confident that I am likely to have it. Now that I vaguely know the symptoms of a flare-up, there is no question as to whether I've had one in the past (I've had many), they've all seemed quite similar (from what I can identify in hindsight). But recently (it could have happened when I was younger too, but I have unfortunately experienced and continue to experience memory loss and gaps in my memory), I've noticed the feelings of urgently needing to go to the toilet (think the desperate urges of diarrhoea) but at the same time, having absolutely nothing come out. Which for me, appears to be new. Is it something in UC or what? As far as I am aware, I haven't eaten any trigger foods that would trigger a typical flare-up (one that I would know straight away as a flare), though I am still in the process of finding my feet. Has anyone else experienced this?

TLDR: Having strong urges to defecate to the point it's quite painful, but nothing seems to be coming and it's really frustrating and hurting. Could this be UC, or is there potential that it's something else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/nrdcf4/bothersome_bowels/,1622726400.0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
dqg0rf,UlcerativeColitis,14 Years of Hell,"Apologies if I'm not suppose to post here (since I'm not being medicated anymore and I've had my surgeries years ago) but I just found this place and I'd honestly just like to share my experience thus far with UC (because I don't typically share it since it's long...and sucks).

Now my memory isn't the best, so dates and ages might be off, but I can still clearly remember the date I had to be pulled out of public school: November 26th, 2005 (5th Grade) in Mission, BC. I left before recess even started, I heard from my sister that day no one even noticed I was gone. I don't remember when exactly I was first admitted into the hospital, all I remember was that it wasn't as immediate as it should have been.

I was 11 years old when we were told I had ""Undetermined Colitis"", something we knew nothing about.

Cue the months of looking through web article after web article to learn more about what might have caused it and what to do. But since this was 2005-2006, there wasn't much out there. I spent my 12th birthday (April 13th, 2006), sitting on the couch and not being allowed to have any of the cake, pop, or chips all my other family members were allowed (my Mum didn't have any because she felt bad for me). During this time, I was on medications, but they were doing nothing for me. I was only getting worse and worse (constantly throwing up whatever I ate, hair falling out, paling even more, pain, weight loss, ect). At one point, I couldn't have anything other than Carnation Instant Breakfast mixed with soy milk.

A week after my birthday (April 20th, 2006), I had to be admitted into the hospital again after I woke up and couldn't stop shaking. My Mum had to argue with my own father to take us to Vancouver to the hospital. He only agreed to take us as far as Abbotsford.

I really hated being in the hospital.

Because I was so sick, they had trouble getting an IV in me. I'd cry every time they came in to try again, it took hours before they could get one in me (they tried every spot they could, in both arms). But during that time, I guess my Mum and them agreed to transfer me to Vancouver Children's Hospital and that had been my first (and so far, only) time in an ambulance. I remember the two ambulance attendees were very nice, the lady complimented the pink bear I had with me.

For the rest of April and part of May, things were going pretty smoothly. I wasn't in pain, I gained more weight. Things were looking up (note: my father was looking after my siblings during this time, his boss let him leave work with pay until I could return home), we celebrated my Mum's birthday (May 19th 2006) which a couple of nurses gave her some flowers. I was thinking that I would finally get to go home soon!

Then, a few days later, my large intestine burst. 

I was rushed to emergency and I learned a month after I was able to return home that my heart stopped 4 times in the ICU. My colon, which had been described to me looking like ""hamburger and bubble wrap"", turned out to be a toxic megacolon. They said if I wasn't in the hospital that night, I would have died. I remember waking up, before knowing what happened or what was going on, feeling absolutely guilty that I put my Mum through that. I  knew she would be upset and that's something that will always kill me inside.

Of course, things weren't better after that, some of the things still affect me to this day (though I'm slowly getting over them). I had to go through physio because I couldn't move my legs (I collapsed to the floor when they said it was okay for me to get out of bed), I still walk with a slight limp. Because I was very depressed from everything, they sent a therapist to my room whenever my Mum wasn't in the room and she would talk to me like I was slow and stupid (I just started seeing a therapist for a different issue but I confessed to her my immense discomfort with therapist and physiogists because of it, she's being super understanding). My surgical scar got infected and they had to reopen it, use adhesive ties to keep it closed while it healed (as revenge, I told them I wanted my staples so 3 old dudes were digging them out of the bin), I'm now super self-conscious about my appearance because of my scar (from below the sternum to my hips). I have a fear of needles and I can't help but to cry when I'm in discomfort (ex: I can't be aware while doing a scope because of my anxiety). I can't have certain foods and drinks (like jello and apple juice) because I will throw it up, having literally only had that for a month and a half. 

It was some time after my little brother's birthday (June 17th, 2006) I was finally allowed out of the hospital. We had a nurse come to our home to change the dressing (the incision was still healing up) and to go through physio. But again, things weren't just suddenly better. And this is where the family complications get added into the mess. 

First off, my father crashes the van in the hospital parking lot. The night I'm admitted out. While it was raining. Luckily, no one was hurt but we lost our van. Second, my father refused to have us covered by medical for my supplies, which meant we had to budget $75 every 2 weeks when we barely had enough for food. Third, we learned I had sensitive skin since the adhesive on the ostomy disks was literally eating at my skin (but we only had so many options for concaved disks that didn't just last me half a day). Fourth, my father ridiculed me to his friends about having to wear a ""poop bag"" when I was already feeling like a literal piece of shit.

But probably the worst, and what was one of the deciding factors in my parents eventual divorce, was that my own father refused for me to go back to the hospital so I could begin having my reconnection surgeries, knowing for a fact how miserable I was. From 11 years, up until I was 17 years old, I had to wear something that caused me so much pain and suffering that it drove me deep into depression. The only reason I never even considered killing myself was because, again, I knew it would upset my Mum and I held onto that love for her like it was a lifesaver (which it was, to be honest).

We left him when I was 15 (and learned in my first appointment in years that I actually had Ulcerative Colitis), I had the first reconnection surgery (a J pouch) when I was 16 (during which my Mum made friends with someone who would later become my Stepdad). The last reconnection surgery to close up everything was when I was 17 (it took a while because I was back in public school, a year behind because of moving but grade 10 was still one of my favorite schooling years). I was admitted out of the hospital on Father's Day during the last surgery, I remember this because my father decides to phone my Mum and asked to talk to me, only for him to tell me how he was going to kill himself because we weren't there and he missed us (I was crying/begging him to stop and my Mum had to take the phone away from me). 

Things were fine up until grade 11, when we had to rush to emergency because my small intestine decided to come out of my body. I remember I had a socials final that day, I remember the doctor saying I would have to wear an ostomy again (for the rest of my life). Next thing I remember, I'm waking up in a room and looking for my phone to text my Mum, I see her messages explaining everything (telling the school and my friends what was going on and that the surgery went great). I remember lifting up my hospital gown and seeing the gauze and tape and no ostomy, ""Oh...nice...I'm hungry...""

Turns out I started to get hysterical and they tranquilized me.

Funniest part of that experience was returning to school, looking for my social teacher and watching his face drain when I asked about the test I missed, ""The test? I just gave you 100%, I don't want you to stress!""

Honestly, things kinda felt normal for a while. I had friends, I had a boyfriend (I'm single again though), my Mum was happy. I graduated high school, got a job, worked hard and I continue working hard. But no issues involving my UC up until this year in March, I had to leave work early and be admitted into the hospital because of a narrowing in my small intestine. They said they found some irritation but it wasn't anything to worry about (because I wasn't in pain or had any symptoms after having the narrowing stretched and put on meds for a week). I have a scope in December.

Which I hope will bring good news.

But that's my story, that's my own experience with everything. I know it's a lot but I just wanted to share something I don't get to share with many people. Most just don't understand the struggle I had to go through to be where I am now (not that I'm in the best place but I'm not in a bad place either). I don't know if anyone will actually care but...I don't know, it feels good to share.

Anyways, good luck to everyone who is going through a difficult time. I wish you all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/dqg0rf/14_years_of_hell/,1572672048.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
