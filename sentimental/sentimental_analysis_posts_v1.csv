1hhpfgu,mentalhealth,"My grandma has Alzheimer’s (maybe depression too), it’s getting worse. How can I help?"," 	My grandma is about 70 years old, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. I have to start back before she was diagnosed. For a while, my family believed that she is depressed. Before COVID, there was a period of time where she’d act different and sit in a dark area of the house, alone doing nothing. But when my little cousin was born, she seems to recover and went back to her normal life where she would cook and do various activities throughout the day, such as picking up my little cousin from school. During COVID, she fell back into the same behavior. She doesn’t cook, doesn’t eat much, doesn’t put much care on hygiene, doesn’t do anything other than sitting in the same place and play sudoku. It was odd. I kept wondering how could a person sit there and play sudoku everyday, no breaks? 
Then, she had an accident where she fell and broke her hip. Was hospitalized for around a week. Initially, when she came home, she didn’t play sudoku at all. She said she forgot how to play them. After a couple weeks, she got back at the Sudoku again but she doesn’t sit in the same place anymore. She sits in the living room. She has a routine: simple exercising with my mother, playing sudoku most of the time, read books for my mom (to let her talk more), and sleep. 
	She likes to say that she doesn’t sleep at night at all, complaining that she has insomnia. She also worry about her digestion, saying she’s constipated even though she’s not. Even when we told her she was snoring, she still said she didn’t sleep at all. 
	Lately, it’s been getting worse. Now, I don’t know if it’s because it’s winter or not but she seems to lose track of time. She’d say I’m going to sleep now when it’s noon, asking my grandpa to give her the sleep medicine (she takes 2 every night). She repeat the same thing again and again, sometimes 3-4 seconds apart. If I were to count, she probably repeat some of these phrases 20-30 times a day. For example, she kept telling me “don’t forget to charge my iPad”. Or, she kept telling my grandpa what she wants for breakfast again and again. We tried to tell her that it’s not time yet but she doesn’t seem to understand. Explaining to her that it’s not time yet doesn’t do anything at all. 
With that being said, she still has a pretty good memory of the past. She remember all the trips we went back then and remember certain events pretty well, so it’s confusing what’s really going on in her mind. Also, for the Alzheimer’s, the doctor said she still in the stages that is not too bad I think. 

I feel so bad for my grandpa since he has to take care of her most of the time. It must be so frustrating for him to listen to the same thing again and again. And the fact that my grandmother doesn’t understand what she’ve been told made it even more tough. If someone experience similar scenario with someone they know, i would really appreciate if you can share it or give me some advice on how me and my family can deal with this. Thank you so much for reading this.

12pp5me,mentalhealth,Feeling left out of family gatherings. Im having to take care of my mom who has Alzheimer’s. Im home everyday day and day out. I rarely go anywhere or do anything.,"So this weekend hubby, 22year old son and GF all went out. My son has always said if I invite one of you that means both of you. I get home from picking up Groceries and they’re leaving. I asked if they could give me a second to wet my hair down and freshen up. They said no we are already to go. So I said I can put groceries away make sure Nana is settled and meat up with you guys. I did exactly that. I was kind of hurt because the place they went after Dinner was an Alice and Wonderland Themed bar. Anyone who knows me knows I love AIW. I have a book club called The Mad Hatters reading group. I’ve loved these stories since childhood. So son and GF basically just brushed me off. That was hurtful because she stays at my home a lot. She gave me an eat shit and die looks. I don’t even think she said hello. Now I’m uncomfortable in my own home and on top of it all I’m caring for my mom who doesn’t even know how to dress herself. I am super uncomfortable around my sons GF now and I feel very isolated. To think they’d go somewhere that’s more my thing than hubbys hurt me. I have said I was sorry that I showed up for an hour but it was fun seeing all the AIW stuff they had. I’ve been in tears on and off since Saturday. My son said I’m glad you guys had fun because we didn’t. Meaning hubby and I had fun. I feel like a girl staying at my house shouldn’t be so rude and not even acknowledge im an actual person and her BF is my son.  I know I’m all over the place with this. I just feel so dead and alone. It’s like my soul is hurting and to express that would make light of my son not having fun because I was there for one hour. I have said I’m sorry. I explained to him what he told me that if I invite one of you meaning his dad or me I am inviting you both. I don’t know what to do and feel like maybe my hubby has said something to make him not want to be around me. Yes I made one remark that I shouldn’t have to hubby but I said I was sorry that it really hurt that they chose a place that was more of something I would like than they would. I also said I was sorry for ruining the evening. And said it was my fault and I hope he can forgive me. He is barely talking to me and I don’t know what else to do. Im so uncomfortable with him and his GF ignoring me.  It hurts and I have so much more than just those 2 to deal with. My mom pooped in her diaper last night so I had to clean her up and put her in the shower. I was crying because I felt overwhelmed. My son said you brought this on yourself. How did I ? I took her to the bathroom like I’m supposed to evey 4 hours.  Am I crazy? Well I am ADHD and bi polar so kind of. Was it wrong for me to want to have a drink with hubby, sonand GF.   Im just wondering how I can feel comfortable here. With them ignoring me and acting like I have the plague. My heart is so broken and I am having suicidal thoughts which I can’t share not just because of them but it’s hard taking care of someone with Alzheimer’s.  Please someone tell me how I can go about letting this woman whose sleeping in my home make me feel less than and worthless. Maybe I am.  Just don’t know how one hour of them being out for hours ruined their entire night. I can’t stop crying and I’m getting really ticked at times being treated poorly and ignored. Any suggestions on how to help them see my point of view? Should we just let them treat me like a doormat. Thanks for any help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12pp5me/feeling_left_out_of_family_gatherings_im_having/,1681751076.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
